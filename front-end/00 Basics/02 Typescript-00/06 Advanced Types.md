Certainly! Advanced TypeScript types such as unions, intersections, tuples, and conditional types offer powerful tools for creating flexible and expressive type definitions. Let's delve into each of these concepts:

### Unions:

Unions allow you to specify that a value can be one of several types. They are denoted by the pipe (`|`) symbol.

```typescript
type Result = number | string;

let result1: Result = 10;    // Valid
let result2: Result = "OK";  // Valid
let result3: Result = true;  // Error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'number | string'.
```

### Intersections:

Intersections allow you to combine multiple types into one. They are denoted by the ampersand (`&`) symbol.

```typescript
type Admin = {
    name: string;
    role: string;
};

type Employee = {
    id: number;
    department: string;
};

type AdminEmployee = Admin & Employee;

let adminEmployee: AdminEmployee = {
    name: "Alice",
    role: "Admin",
    id: 123,
    department: "Engineering"
};
```

### Tuples:

Tuples are arrays with a fixed number of elements where each element may have a different type. They provide a way to express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known, but the number of elements is not fixed.

```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 30];

let coordinates: [number, number, number] = [10, 20, 30];
```

### Conditional Types:

Conditional types allow you to create types that depend on other types. They are often used in generic types to create flexible and conditional behavior.

```typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T;

type NullableString = string | null | undefined;
type NonNullableString = NonNullable<NullableString>; // Evaluates to `string`
```

### Type Guards:

Type guards are conditional statements that allow TypeScript to narrow down the type of a variable within a certain block of code. They are often used in conjunction with unions.

```typescript
function printResult(value: string | number) {
    if (typeof value === "string") {
        console.log("String value:", value.toUpperCase());
    } else {
        console.log("Number value:", value.toFixed(2));
    }
}
```

### Mapped Types:

Mapped types allow you to create new types from existing ones by applying a transformation to each property in the original type.

```typescript
type Person = {
    name: string;
    age: number;
};

type ReadonlyPerson = {
    readonly [K in keyof Person]: Person[K];
};
```

These advanced TypeScript types provide developers with powerful tools for creating complex and flexible type definitions, improving the type safety and expressiveness of their code.
