Interfaces and type aliases are powerful features in TypeScript that allow developers to define custom data structures and shape the types used in their code. Let's explore each concept:

### Interfaces:

Interfaces define the structure of objects in TypeScript. They provide a way to name and specify the types of object properties and method signatures.

```typescript
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
    greet(): string;
}

let person: Person = {
    firstName: "Alice",
    lastName: "Smith",
    age: 30,
    greet() {
        return `Hello, ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}!`;
    }
};

console.log(person.greet()); // Output: Hello, Alice Smith!
```

### Type Aliases:

Type aliases allow developers to create custom names for any type. They can simplify complex type expressions, improve code readability, and provide semantic meaning to types.

```typescript
type Point = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
};

let point: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
```

### Differences:

- **Interfaces**: 
  - Can be extended and implemented by classes.
  - Can't represent primitive types, unions, or intersections directly.
  - Are open-ended, meaning you can add new properties to an interface even after it's defined.

- **Type Aliases**:
  - Are more flexible and can represent primitive types, unions, intersections, and tuples directly.
  - Cannot be extended or implemented by classes.
  - Are closed, meaning you can't add new properties to a type alias once it's defined.

### When to Use Which:

- **Interfaces** are typically used to define contracts for objects, especially when defining shapes of data for classes or when you need to implement them.
- **Type Aliases** are useful for creating complex and reusable types, especially when dealing with unions, intersections, or tuples, or when you need to provide semantic names for types.

### Combining Interfaces and Type Aliases:

You can also combine interfaces and type aliases to create more expressive and reusable types:

```typescript
interface Shape {
    color: string;
}

type Point = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
};

type Circle = Shape & {
    radius: number;
};

let circle: Circle = {
    color: "red",
    radius: 10,
};
```

By understanding interfaces and type aliases, developers can define clear and structured types that improve the readability and maintainability of their TypeScript code.
