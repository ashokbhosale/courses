Middleware plays a crucial role in logging and debugging within Express applications. Here's how you can implement middleware for logging requests and errors, as well as debug Express applications:

1. **Logging Middleware for Requests**:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   // Middleware for logging requests
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
       console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
       next();
   });

   // Routes
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello World!');
   });

   // Start server
   const port = 3000;
   app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

   This middleware logs every request's method and URL to the console.

2. **Error Handling Middleware**:

   ```javascript
   // Error handling middleware
   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
       console.error(err.stack);
       res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
   });
   ```

   This middleware catches any errors that occur during request processing and sends an error response.

3. **Debugging Express Applications**:

   Express applications can be debugged using various methods:

   - **Logging**: Utilize `console.log`, `console.error`, or a logging library like Winston to log information at different points in your application. This can help trace the flow of execution and identify any issues.
   
   - **Debugging Tools**: Tools like `debug` module allow you to add debug messages to your code and selectively enable them based on environment variables or configurations. This can be particularly useful for debugging complex applications.

   - **Debugger**: Node.js comes with a built-in debugger. You can start your application in debug mode by running `node --inspect server.js` and connect to it using Chrome DevTools or a dedicated debugger like VSCode.

   - **Third-Party Tools**: There are also third-party tools like New Relic, AppDynamics, or even simple monitoring services like Sentry or Loggly that can help in monitoring and debugging Express applications by providing insights into application performance and errors.

By implementing logging middleware for requests, error handling middleware, and using various debugging techniques, you can effectively debug and monitor your Express applications.
