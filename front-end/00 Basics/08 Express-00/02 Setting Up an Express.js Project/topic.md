Setting up an Express.js project is straightforward and involves installing Express.js using npm and setting up a basic project structure. Here's how you can do it:

### Installing Express.js using npm

1. **Initialize Node.js Project:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Express.js project.
   - Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```
   - This command creates a `package.json` file with default settings.

2. **Install Express.js:**
   - Run the following command to install Express.js as a dependency for your project:
     ```bash
     npm install express
     ```
   - This command installs Express.js and adds it to the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file.

### Basic Project Structure and Setup

Once you've installed Express.js, you can set up a basic project structure and create the entry point for your Express.js application.

1. **Create Project Files:**
   - Create a new file named `app.js` (or any other name you prefer) in your project directory. This file will serve as the entry point for your Express.js application.

2. **Write Express.js Code:**
   - Open `app.js` in your code editor and import Express.js at the top of the file:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     ```

3. **Initialize Express App:**
   - Create an instance of the Express application by calling the `express()` function:
     ```javascript
     const app = express();
     ```

4. **Define Routes:**
   - Define routes to handle different HTTP requests using the Express router. For example:
     ```javascript
     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, Express!');
     });
     ```

5. **Start the Server:**
   - Finally, start the Express server and specify the port number your application will listen on:
     ```javascript
     const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

     app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
     });
     ```

### Final Project Structure:

Your project directory should look something like this:

```
project-root/
│
├── node_modules/
│
├── app.js
├── package.json
└── package-lock.json
```

### Running Your Express.js Application

To run your Express.js application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node app.js
```

This command starts the Express server, and you should see the message "Server is running on port 3000" (or whichever port you specified) logged to the console.

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate URL) to see your Express.js application in action, displaying "Hello, Express!" as the response.

That's it! You've successfully set up an Express.js project, defined a basic project structure, and created your first Express.js application. You can now start building more complex features and functionalities using Express.js.
