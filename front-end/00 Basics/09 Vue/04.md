**Vue Directives**

Vue directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element or component. They are prefixed with `v-`, followed by the directive name. Vue provides a set of built-in directives to manipulate the DOM and handle data binding efficiently.

1. **Common Directives**:

   - **v-bind**: This directive is used for dynamic attribute binding. It binds an element's attribute to an expression, allowing you to dynamically update HTML attributes based on data in the Vue instance. For example:
     ```html
     <img v-bind:src="imageUrl">
     ```

   - **v-for**: This directive is used for rendering lists. It iterates over an array and renders a template for each item in the array. For example:
     ```html
     <ul>
       <li v-for="item in items">{{ item }}</li>
     </ul>
     ```

   - **v-if**: This directive conditionally renders an element based on the truthiness of the expression. If the expression evaluates to true, the element is rendered; otherwise, it is removed from the DOM. For example:
     ```html
     <div v-if="isVisible">Visible</div>
     ```

2. **Event Handling with v-on**:

   - **v-on**: This directive is used for event handling. It listens to DOM events and triggers methods or expressions when the event occurs. You can specify the event name after `v-on:` and the method or expression to execute. For example:
     ```html
     <button v-on:click="handleClick">Click me</button>
     ```

3. **Class and Style Bindings**:

   - **v-bind:class**: This directive allows you to dynamically bind CSS classes to an element based on data in the Vue instance. You can pass an object, array, or string to conditionally apply classes. For example:
     ```html
     <div v-bind:class="{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }"></div>
     ```

   - **v-bind:style**: This directive allows you to dynamically bind inline styles to an element based on data in the Vue instance. You can pass an object with CSS properties and values. For example:
     ```html
     <div v-bind:style="{ color: textColor, fontSize: textSize + 'px' }"></div>
     ```

   - You can also use shorthand syntax for `v-bind` and `v-on` directives:
     ```html
     <!-- Shorthand for v-bind -->
     <img :src="imageUrl">
     
     <!-- Shorthand for v-on -->
     <button @click="handleClick">Click me</button>
     ```

Vue directives are powerful tools for manipulating the DOM, handling events, and performing data binding in Vue.js applications. By mastering these directives, you can create dynamic and interactive user interfaces with ease.
