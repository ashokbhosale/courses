**Computed Properties and Watchers in Vue.js**

1. **Computed Properties for Data Manipulation**:

   Computed properties are functions in a Vue.js instance that are calculated based on the reactive data properties. They are cached and only re-evaluated when their dependent data properties change. Computed properties are useful for performing data manipulation, transformations, and calculations without directly modifying the underlying data.

   Example of using computed properties:
   ```html
   <div id="app">
     <p>Original message: {{ message }}</p>
     <p>Reversed message: {{ reversedMessage }}</p>
   </div>
   ```

   ```javascript
   var app = new Vue({
     el: '#app',
     data: {
       message: 'Hello, Vue!'
     },
     computed: {
       reversedMessage: function() {
         return this.message.split('').reverse().join('');
       }
     }
   });
   ```

   In this example, the `reversedMessage` computed property returns the reversed version of the `message` data property. Whenever the `message` property changes, the `reversedMessage` property will automatically update.

2. **Watching for Data Changes with Watchers**:

   Watchers in Vue.js allow you to perform asynchronous or expensive operations in response to changes in data properties. Unlike computed properties, watchers do not return a value but instead watch for changes on a specific data property and execute a callback function when the property changes.

   Example of using watchers:
   ```javascript
   var app = new Vue({
     el: '#app',
     data: {
       message: 'Hello, Vue!'
     },
     watch: {
       message: function(newVal, oldVal) {
         console.log('Message changed from ' + oldVal + ' to ' + newVal);
       }
     }
   });
   ```

   In this example, a watcher is defined for the `message` data property. Whenever the value of `message` changes, the watcher function is called with the new value (`newVal`) and the old value (`oldVal`).

3. **Understanding Reactivity in Vue.js**:

   Reactivity is a core concept in Vue.js that refers to the automatic updating of the DOM based on changes to the underlying data. Vue.js achieves reactivity through its reactive data properties, which are tracked by the Vue.js reactivity system.

   When a data property changes, Vue.js automatically detects the change and updates any affected DOM elements. This reactive behavior applies not only to data properties but also to computed properties, watchers, and template expressions.

   Vue.js uses a dependency tracking system to track dependencies between data properties and their associated DOM elements or computed properties. When a dependency changes, Vue.js re-evaluates the affected parts of the DOM and updates them accordingly, ensuring that the UI remains in sync with the underlying data.

   Understanding reactivity is crucial for developing Vue.js applications efficiently and taking advantage of Vue.js's reactive nature to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
