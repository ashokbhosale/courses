Angular is a popular open-source web application framework that is developed and maintained by Google and a community of developers. It is used for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and is known for its robustness, modularity, and extensive features. Here are the key features and concepts of Angular:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:**
    
    - Angular applications are organized around components, which are self-contained, reusable building blocks that encapsulate HTML templates, CSS styles, and TypeScript code. Components can be nested to create complex UIs.
2. **Declarative Templates:**
    
    - Angular uses declarative templates with HTML to define the UI of an application. You can bind data to the templates using interpolation, property binding, and event binding.
3. **Two-Way Data Binding:**
    
    - Angular offers two-way data binding, which means changes in the UI are automatically reflected in the underlying data model, and vice versa. This simplifies the synchronization of data.
4. **Dependency Injection:**
    
    - Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that allows you to inject dependencies into components, services, and other parts of your application. This promotes modularity and testability.
5. **Directives:**
    
    - Angular provides a range of built-in directives, such as ngFor, ngIf, and ngSwitch, to manipulate the DOM and dynamically render content based on conditions.
6. **Services:**
    
    - Services in Angular are used for encapsulating business logic, making HTTP requests, and sharing data between components. They are singleton objects and can be injected into components.
7. **Routing:**
    
    - Angular's router allows you to create complex navigation structures and implement client-side routing for SPAs. You can define routes and route parameters, enabling deep linking.
8. **Modules:**
    
    - Angular applications are organized into modules, which help in structuring and organizing code. Modules can contain components, services, and other application features.
9. **HTTP Client:**
    
    - Angular provides an HTTP client module for making HTTP requests to APIs and handling responses. It supports various request methods and request options.
10. **Form Handling:**
    
    - Angular has robust support for working with forms, including template-driven forms and reactive forms. You can create complex forms, validate user input, and handle form submissions.
11. **Observables:**
    
    - Angular leverages RxJS, which is a library for working with asynchronous data streams. Observables are used to handle events, manage data streams, and facilitate communication between components.
12. **Testing:**
    
    - Angular has a strong testing ecosystem, including tools like Jasmine and Karma. You can write unit tests, end-to-end tests, and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your application.
13. **Internationalization (i18n) and Accessibility:**
    
    - Angular provides built-in features for internationalization and localization, making it easier to create applications that can be used by a global audience. Additionally, Angular encourages accessibility best practices.
14. **Cross-Platform Development:**
    
    - Angular is not limited to web applications; it can be used for cross-platform development. Angular allows you to build web applications, desktop applications, and mobile applications using technologies like Angular Universal and NativeScript.
15. **Community and Ecosystem:**
    
    - Angular has a large and active community of developers, as well as a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries, plugins, and extensions. This community support and ecosystem make it easier to find solutions to common problems.
16. **Official Documentation and CLI:**
    
    - Angular offers well-documented resources and an official CLI (Command Line Interface) that streamlines project setup, code generation, and development tasks.

Angular is a powerful framework for building complex web applications and has a wide range of use cases, from small projects to enterprise-level applications. Its extensive features, strong developer community, and Google's backing make it a popular choice for web development.
