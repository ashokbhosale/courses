The `let` and `const` keywords are used for variable declaration in JavaScript, and they have different behaviors in terms of scoping and mutability. Here's an explanation of each:

## `let`:

- **Variable Declaration:**
  - Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned.

- **Scoping:**
  - `let` has block-level scope, meaning the variable is only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where it is defined.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  if (true) {
    let x = 10;
    console.log(x); // 10
  }

  // x is not accessible here
  ```

- **Reassignment:**
  ```javascript
  let y = 5;
  y = 8; // Valid

  let y = 10; // Error: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
  ```

- **Hoisting:**
  - `let` is hoisted to the top of its block but is not initialized until the declaration is reached.

## `const`:

- **Variable Declaration:**
  - Variables declared with `const` are constants and cannot be reassigned.

- **Scoping:**
  - Like `let`, `const` also has block-level scope.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  if (true) {
    const PI = 3.14;
    console.log(PI); // 3.14
  }

  // PI is not accessible here
  ```

- **Reassignment:**
  ```javascript
  const z = 5;
  z = 8; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.

  const z = 10; // Error: Identifier 'z' has already been declared
  ```

- **Value Assignment:**
  - `const` variables must be assigned a value during declaration.

  ```javascript
  const MY_CONSTANT; // Error: Missing initializer in const declaration
  ```

- **Use Cases:**
  - Use `const` for values that should not be reassigned (e.g., constants, configuration settings).
  - Note: While the variable itself is immutable, if it's an object or array, the properties or elements can still be modified.

- **Hoisting:**
  - Similar to `let`, `const` is hoisted to the top of its block but is not initialized until the declaration is reached.

In summary, `let` is used for variables that may be reassigned, and it has block-level scope. On the other hand, `const` is used for variables that should not be reassigned, providing a level of immutability, and it also has block-level scope. Both `let` and `const` help in avoiding unintended variable reassignment and contribute to better code maintainability and predictability. Choosing between them depends on the intended use and whether reassignment is needed in your code.
