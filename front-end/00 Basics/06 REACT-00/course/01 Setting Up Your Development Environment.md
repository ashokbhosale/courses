To get started with React, you'll need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), and then create your first React application using Create React App. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1. Install Node.js and npm:**

Node.js and npm come bundled together. To install them, follow these steps:

- Visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/.
- Download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version, which is recommended for most users.
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

To verify that Node.js and npm are correctly installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

These commands should display the installed Node.js and npm versions.

**2. Create Your First React Application:**

Now that you have Node.js and npm installed, you can create your first React application using Create React App (CRA), which is an official tool for bootstrapping React projects. To create a new React app, follow these steps:

- Open your terminal or command prompt.

- Run the following command to create a new React app. Replace `my-react-app` with the desired name of your app:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

- Wait for the installation and project setup to complete. Create React App will create a new directory for your project and install the necessary dependencies.

- Once the process is finished, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

**3. Start Your Development Server:**

To start your development server and see your React app in action, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open your default web browser to display the React app. You should see a "Welcome to React" message in your browser.

**4. Explore Your React App:**

The Create React App setup includes a sample React application with a basic folder structure. You can explore and modify the code in the `src` directory. The main entry point for your app is usually `src/index.js`.

You can make changes to the code, create new components, and add features to your React application. Any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the development server, and you can see the results in your browser.

Congratulations, you've successfully created your first React application using Create React App! You can now start building your React components and applications. If you'd like to add additional dependencies or libraries to your project, you can use npm to install them as needed.
