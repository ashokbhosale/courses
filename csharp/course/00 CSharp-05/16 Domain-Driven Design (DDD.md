**Overview of Domain-Driven Design (DDD):**

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on understanding and modeling the domain of the problem space, and using that understanding to inform the design of the software system. DDD aims to align the structure of the software with the mental model of the domain experts, leading to more effective communication, better problem-solving, and higher-quality software.

**Strategic Design:**

- **Bounded Contexts:** Bounded contexts define explicit boundaries within which a particular model or set of concepts applies. Each bounded context represents a specific area of the problem domain and may have its own language, concepts, and models. Bounded contexts help to manage complexity and ensure that models remain cohesive and consistent within their context.

- **Aggregates:** Aggregates are clusters of related domain objects that are treated as a single unit for the purpose of data changes and consistency. Aggregates enforce transactional consistency boundaries and encapsulate business rules and invariants.

- **Entities:** Entities are domain objects with a unique identity that persists over time. Entities have behavior and state, and they are defined by their identity rather than their attributes.

- **Value Objects:** Value objects are domain objects that have no conceptual identity and are defined by their attributes or values. Value objects are immutable and can be shared and compared based on their values.

**Tactical Design:**

- **Repositories:** Repositories provide a mechanism for accessing and managing domain objects. Repositories abstract away the details of data access and provide a collection-like interface for querying and persisting domain objects.

- **Domain Services:** Domain services encapsulate behavior or operations that do not naturally belong to any specific entity or value object. Domain services represent domain concepts or operations that are not directly related to the state of a single entity.

- **Domain Events:** Domain events represent significant state changes or occurrences within the domain. Domain events are used to communicate changes or triggers between different parts of the domain model or between bounded contexts.

**Implementing DDD Principles in C# Applications with .NET Core:**

Below is an example of implementing DDD principles in a .NET Core application:

```csharp
// Domain Entities
public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
    public List<OrderItem> Items { get; set; }
}

public class OrderItem
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

// Value Object
public class Money
{
    public decimal Amount { get; set; }
    public string Currency { get; set; }
}

// Domain Service
public interface IOrderService
{
    void PlaceOrder(Order order);
    Money CalculateTotalPrice(Order order);
}

public class OrderService : IOrderService
{
    public void PlaceOrder(Order order)
    {
        // Logic for placing an order
    }

    public Money CalculateTotalPrice(Order order)
    {
        // Logic for calculating total price
        return new Money { Amount = order.Items.Sum(item => item.Price * item.Quantity), Currency = "USD" };
    }
}

// Repository Interface
public interface IOrderRepository
{
    Order GetById(int id);
    void Add(Order order);
    void Update(Order order);
    void Delete(int id);
}

// Implementation of Repository
public class OrderRepository : IOrderRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;

    public OrderRepository(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public Order GetById(int id)
    {
        return _context.Orders.FirstOrDefault(o => o.Id == id);
    }

    // Implement other repository methods...
}

// Usage Example
public class OrderController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IOrderService _orderService;
    private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;

    public OrderController(IOrderService orderService, IOrderRepository orderRepository)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
        _orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult PlaceOrder(Order order)
    {
        _orderService.PlaceOrder(order);
        _orderRepository.Add(order);
        return Ok();
    }

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetOrder(int id)
    {
        var order = _orderRepository.GetById(id);
        if (order == null)
            return NotFound();

        return Ok(order);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The domain entities (`Order` and `OrderItem`) represent the core concepts of the domain.
- The `Money` class represents a value object that encapsulates the concept of monetary value.
- The `OrderService` class implements domain logic related to placing orders and calculating total prices.
- The `OrderRepository` class implements data access logic for working with orders in the database.
- The `OrderController` class acts as the adapter between the application's HTTP endpoints and the domain logic, using the `IOrderService` and `IOrderRepository` interfaces to interact with the domain layer.
- This architecture separates concerns, promotes domain-driven design, and enables a clear separation of responsibilities within the application.
