**Resilience Engineering Principles and Practices:**

Resilience engineering focuses on building systems that can adapt and recover from failures, disruptions, and unexpected events. Here are some key principles and practices of resilience engineering:

1. **Fault Isolation:** Design systems to contain failures within specific components or modules, preventing them from cascading and affecting the entire system.

2. **Redundancy:** Introduce redundancy in critical components to provide backup mechanisms and ensure system availability in case of failures.

3. **Failover Mechanisms:** Implement failover mechanisms to automatically switch to backup components or systems when failures occur, minimizing downtime and service disruptions.

4. **Fallback Strategies:** Define fallback strategies to gracefully degrade system functionality when certain components or features are unavailable or degraded.

5. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Use the Circuit Breaker pattern to monitor and control interactions with external systems or services. The circuit breaker trips when a certain threshold of failures is reached, temporarily stopping further requests to the failing component and allowing it to recover.

6. **Retry Logic:** Implement retry logic to automatically retry failed operations, with exponential backoff strategies to avoid overwhelming the system during transient failures.

7. **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for external calls and operations to prevent blocking and resource exhaustion, ensuring timely responses and avoiding cascading failures.

**Patterns for Building Resilient Architectures in C# Applications:**

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
   
```csharp
public async Task<string> CallExternalServiceWithCircuitBreakerAsync()
{
    var policy = Policy
        .Handle<HttpRequestException>()
        .CircuitBreakerAsync(3, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));

    return await policy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
    {
        using (var client = new HttpClient())
        {
            var response = await client.GetAsync("http://external-service.com/api/data");
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        }
    });
}
```

2. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff:**

```csharp
public async Task<string> CallExternalServiceWithRetryAsync()
{
    var policy = Policy
        .Handle<HttpRequestException>()
        .WaitAndRetryAsync(3, retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, retryAttempt)));

    return await policy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
    {
        using (var client = new HttpClient())
        {
            var response = await client.GetAsync("http://external-service.com/api/data");
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        }
    });
}
```

3. **Timeouts:**

```csharp
public async Task<string> CallExternalServiceWithTimeoutAsync()
{
    var timeoutPolicy = Policy.TimeoutAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));

    return await timeoutPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =>
    {
        using (var client = new HttpClient())
        {
            var response = await client.GetAsync("http://external-service.com/api/data");
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        }
    });
}
```

**Handling Failures, Retries, and Timeouts:**

In the examples above, the `Policy` class from the Polly library is used to define resilience policies such as circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts. These policies are applied to the execution of asynchronous operations, such as calling an external service using HttpClient.

- **Circuit Breaker:** The circuit breaker policy is applied to the HttpClient request, and it will trip after 3 consecutive failures, preventing further requests for 30 seconds.
  
- **Retry Logic:** The retry policy will automatically retry the HttpClient request up to 3 times with exponential backoff between retries.
  
- **Timeouts:** The timeout policy ensures that the HttpClient request completes within 10 seconds, throwing a TimeoutRejectedException if it exceeds the specified duration.

By incorporating these patterns and practices into C# applications, you can build resilient systems that can withstand failures and disruptions, ensuring high availability and reliability.
