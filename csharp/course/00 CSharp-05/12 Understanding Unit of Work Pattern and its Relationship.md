**Understanding Unit of Work Pattern and its Relationship with Repository Pattern:**

The Unit of Work pattern is a design pattern that manages transactions and ensures data consistency by tracking changes made to one or more repositories and committing or rolling back those changes as a single unit. It acts as a higher-level abstraction that coordinates the operations of multiple repositories within a single transaction.

The Unit of Work pattern is closely related to the Repository Pattern, as the repositories typically interact with the data storage mechanism (such as a database) to perform CRUD operations on data entities. While the Repository Pattern provides a way to encapsulate data access logic for individual entities, the Unit of Work pattern provides a way to coordinate the operations of multiple repositories within a transactional boundary.

**Implementing Unit of Work Pattern in C# Applications for Managing Transactions and Data Consistency:**

Below is an example of implementing the Unit of Work pattern in a .NET Core application using Entity Framework Core for managing transactions and data consistency:

```csharp
// IUnitOfWork.cs
public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    IRepository<TEntity> GetRepository<TEntity>() where TEntity : class, IEntity;
    void SaveChanges();
}

// UnitOfWork.cs
public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;
    private Dictionary<Type, object> _repositories;

    public UnitOfWork(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
        _repositories = new Dictionary<Type, object>();
    }

    public IRepository<TEntity> GetRepository<TEntity>() where TEntity : class, IEntity
    {
        if (_repositories.ContainsKey(typeof(TEntity)))
        {
            return _repositories[typeof(TEntity)] as IRepository<TEntity>;
        }

        var repository = new Repository<TEntity>(_context);
        _repositories.Add(typeof(TEntity), repository);
        return repository;
    }

    public void SaveChanges()
    {
        _context.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _context.Dispose();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `IUnitOfWork` interface defines the contract for the Unit of Work pattern, including methods for getting repositories and saving changes.
- The `UnitOfWork` class implements the `IUnitOfWork` interface and manages the DbContext instance provided by Entity Framework Core.
- The `GetRepository` method retrieves or creates repository instances for different entity types.
- The `SaveChanges` method saves all changes made to the entities managed by the DbContext within a single transaction.

**Usage Example:**

```csharp
// Usage example in a service or controller
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IUnitOfWork _unitOfWork;

    public ProductService(IUnitOfWork unitOfWork)
    {
        _unitOfWork = unitOfWork;
    }

    public void AddProduct(Product product)
    {
        var productRepository = _unitOfWork.GetRepository<Product>();
        productRepository.Add(product);

        // Other operations...

        _unitOfWork.SaveChanges();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ProductService` class uses the `IUnitOfWork` interface to interact with repositories and perform operations within a single transaction managed by the Unit of Work. Changes made to the entities are only persisted to the database when `SaveChanges` is called on the Unit of Work.
