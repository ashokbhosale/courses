**Introduction to Hexagonal Architecture:**

Hexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters architecture, is a architectural pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of the application's core business logic from external dependencies such as databases, UI frameworks, or third-party services. In Hexagonal Architecture, the core business logic is surrounded by layers of ports and adapters, which facilitate communication with external systems.

**Ports and Adapters: Defining Interfaces and Adapters:**

- **Ports:** Ports define interfaces through which the application interacts with external systems or components. These interfaces represent the boundaries of the application and define the expected behavior or contract that must be fulfilled by external systems. Ports can be inbound (for receiving data) or outbound (for sending data).

- **Adapters:** Adapters implement the interfaces defined by ports and provide the necessary logic to interact with external systems. Adapters are responsible for translating data between the application's internal representation and the external format expected by external systems. Adapters can be specific to different external systems or technologies.

**Implementing Hexagonal Architecture in C# Applications:**

Below is an example of implementing Hexagonal Architecture in a .NET Core application:

```csharp
// Core Business Logic (Domain Model)
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository;

    public ProductService(IProductRepository productRepository)
    {
        _productRepository = productRepository;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetProducts()
    {
        return _productRepository.GetAll();
    }

    public void AddProduct(Product product)
    {
        _productRepository.Add(product);
    }
}

// Port: Product Repository Interface
public interface IProductRepository
{
    IEnumerable<Product> GetAll();
    void Add(Product product);
}

// Adapter: Entity Framework Core Product Repository
public class EFProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;

    public EFProductRepository(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll()
    {
        return _context.Products.ToList();
    }

    public void Add(Product product)
    {
        _context.Products.Add(product);
        _context.SaveChanges();
    }
}

// Adapter: ASP.NET Core Controller
public class ProductController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ProductService _productService;

    public ProductController(ProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetProducts()
    {
        var products = _productService.GetProducts();
        return Ok(products);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult AddProduct(Product product)
    {
        _productService.AddProduct(product);
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `ProductService` represents the core business logic of the application, which is decoupled from external dependencies.
- `IProductRepository` defines the port through which the application interacts with the data storage system.
- `EFProductRepository` is an adapter that implements the `IProductRepository` interface using Entity Framework Core for data access.
- `ProductController` is an adapter that exposes HTTP endpoints for interacting with the `ProductService` through the ASP.NET Core framework.
- This architecture enables the core business logic to remain independent of external systems, facilitating testing, maintainability, and flexibility.
