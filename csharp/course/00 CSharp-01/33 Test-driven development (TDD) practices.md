Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. Here's how you can apply TDD practices in .NET Core C#:

### 1. Write a Failing Test

- Begin by writing a failing test that describes the behavior you want to implement. This test should fail because the functionality doesn't exist yet.

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;

[TestFixture]
public class CalculatorTests
{
    [Test]
    public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsSum()
    {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        
        int result = calculator.Add(3, 5);
        
        Assert.AreEqual(8, result);
    }
}
```

### 2. Write the Minimum Code to Pass the Test

- Implement the minimum amount of code required to make the failing test pass. This code may not be perfect or complete; it's just enough to satisfy the test.

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### 3. Refactor

- Once the test passes, refactor your code to improve its design, readability, and performance. Ensure that all tests continue to pass after refactoring.

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

### 4. Repeat

- Repeat the process for each new feature or behavior you want to implement, writing failing tests, writing code to pass the tests, and refactoring as necessary.

### Benefits of TDD:

- **Improved Code Quality**: TDD encourages writing clean, modular, and well-tested code.
- **Rapid Feedback**: TDD provides rapid feedback on code changes, allowing developers to catch bugs early.
- **Design Guidance**: TDD helps drive the design of the code based on its intended behavior.
- **Regression Testing**: With a comprehensive suite of tests, you can ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.

### Tools for TDD in .NET Core C#:

- **xUnit.NET**: A popular unit testing framework for .NET Core.
- **NUnit**: Another widely used unit testing framework with support for .NET Core.
- **Moq**: A mocking library for creating mock objects in unit tests.
- **FluentAssertions**: A fluent assertion library that makes test assertions more expressive.

By following TDD practices, you can create more reliable, maintainable, and well-designed code in your .NET Core C# projects. Let me know if you need further clarification or more examples!
