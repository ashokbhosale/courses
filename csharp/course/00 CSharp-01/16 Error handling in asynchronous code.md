Error handling in asynchronous code in .NET Core C# involves handling exceptions that occur during asynchronous operations. Since asynchronous methods return tasks that represent ongoing operations, exceptions thrown during these operations need to be properly handled to prevent them from propagating and crashing the application. Here's how you can handle errors in asynchronous code:

### Try-Catch Blocks

You can use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions thrown by asynchronous operations.

```csharp
public async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    try
    {
        // Asynchronous operation that might throw an exception
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Something went wrong.");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

### Await and Exception Handling

When awaiting asynchronous operations, you can use a try-catch block to handle exceptions.

```csharp
public async Task DoSomethingAsync()
{
    try
    {
        // Asynchronous operation that might throw an exception
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Something went wrong.");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

### Task Exception Propagation

Exceptions thrown by asynchronous operations are propagated back to the calling code when awaiting tasks. You can catch these exceptions using try-catch blocks in the calling code.

```csharp
public async Task MainAsync()
{
    try
    {
        await DoSomethingAsync();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error in MainAsync: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

### AggregateException

When awaiting multiple tasks concurrently, exceptions from individual tasks are aggregated into an `AggregateException`. You can use the `InnerExceptions` property to access individual exceptions.

```csharp
public async Task MainAsync()
{
    try
    {
        Task task1 = DoSomethingAsync();
        Task task2 = DoSomethingElseAsync();

        await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2);
    }
    catch (AggregateException ex)
    {
        foreach (var innerEx in ex.InnerExceptions)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Error: {innerEx.Message}");
        }
    }
}
```

### TaskCompletionSource and Try-Catch

When dealing with asynchronous operations that don't return a `Task`, you can use `TaskCompletionSource` to create a task and handle exceptions using a try-catch block.

```csharp
public Task<int> DivideAsync(int x, int y)
{
    TaskCompletionSource<int> tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<int>();

    try
    {
        int result = x / y;
        tcs.SetResult(result);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        tcs.SetException(ex);
    }

    return tcs.Task;
}
```

These are some common approaches to error handling in asynchronous code in .NET Core C#. Proper error handling ensures that your application remains stable and resilient even in the face of unexpected exceptions during asynchronous operations.
