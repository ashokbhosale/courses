Data migration and versioning are essential aspects of database management, especially in evolving applications where schema changes and data updates are frequent. In .NET Core C#, you can manage data migration and versioning using Entity Framework Core's migrations feature. Here's how to handle data migration and versioning:

### 1. Enable Migrations

Before you can create and apply migrations, you need to enable migrations for your Entity Framework Core DbContext.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

### 2. Create Migrations

Create migrations to represent changes to your database schema. Each migration contains a set of instructions to update the database schema to match the current state of your DbContext.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddNewTable
```

### 3. Apply Migrations

Apply migrations to update the database schema to the latest version. This process executes the SQL commands generated by Entity Framework Core based on the migrations.

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### 4. Rollback Migrations

If needed, you can rollback migrations to revert the database schema to a previous state. This is useful for undoing changes or fixing issues introduced by a migration.

```bash
dotnet ef database update <PreviousMigrationName>
```

### 5. Data Seeding

You can seed initial data into the database using the `OnModelCreating` method in your DbContext or by creating custom migration scripts.

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().HasData(
        new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Product 1" },
        new Product { Id = 2, Name = "Product 2" }
    );
}
```

### 6. Handle Versioning

You can manage database versioning by maintaining a record of applied migrations. This allows you to track the current state of the database schema and apply new migrations as needed.

### 7. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Automate the migration process as part of your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that database changes are applied consistently across environments.

### 8. Handle Breaking Changes

Carefully manage breaking changes to the database schema by coordinating schema changes with application releases and ensuring backward compatibility when possible.

### 9. Testing

Thoroughly test migrations in a development or staging environment before applying them to production to avoid data loss or corruption.

### 10. Version Control

Keep migrations and database schema changes under version control to track changes over time and facilitate collaboration among team members.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage data migration and versioning in .NET Core C# applications using Entity Framework Core. Let me know if you need further clarification or more examples!
