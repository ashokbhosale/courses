In C# .NET Core, types are classified into two main categories: value types and reference types. Understanding the differences between these two types is crucial for efficient memory management and behavior of your application. Here's an overview of value types vs. reference types:

### Value Types

Value types directly contain their data, and instances of value types are stored on the stack or inline in the containing object (if they are part of a class). Some common examples of value types include `int`, `float`, `char`, `struct`, `enum`, and `bool`.

1. **Stored on Stack**: Value types are typically stored on the stack when they are declared as local variables or method parameters. This allows for efficient memory allocation and deallocation, as stack memory is automatically managed by the runtime.

2. **Copy by Value**: When you assign a value type to another variable, a copy of the value is made. Modifications to one variable do not affect the other.

3. **Fixed Size**: Value types have a fixed size determined by their type. This makes them suitable for scenarios where memory usage needs to be tightly controlled.

4. **No Garbage Collection Overhead**: Value types do not require garbage collection, as they are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope.

### Reference Types

Reference types store references to their data, and instances of reference types are stored on the heap. Common examples of reference types include classes, arrays, interfaces, delegates, and strings.

1. **Stored on Heap**: Reference types are stored on the heap, which is a region of memory managed by the garbage collector. This allows for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

2. **Copy by Reference**: When you assign a reference type to another variable, you are copying the reference (memory address), not the actual data. Both variables refer to the same object on the heap.

3. **Dynamic Size**: Reference types can have a dynamic size, depending on the size of their data and the number of fields they contain.

4. **Garbage Collection Overhead**: Reference types require garbage collection to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. This introduces some overhead, especially for large and long-lived objects.

### Choosing Between Value Types and Reference Types

Here are some considerations when choosing between value types and reference types:

- Use value types for small, immutable data types or when you need stack allocation and copy semantics.
- Use reference types for larger, mutable data structures or when you need dynamic memory allocation and sharing of data between multiple variables.
- Consider the performance and memory overhead of garbage collection when designing your application's data structures and object lifetimes.
