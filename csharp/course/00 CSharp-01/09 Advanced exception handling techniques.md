	Advanced exception handling techniques in .NET Core (and C# in general) involve using features like exception filters, custom exception types, async exception handling, and global exception handling. Here's an overview of these techniques:

### Exception Filters
Exception filters allow you to specify additional conditions under which an exception handler should be executed.

```csharp
try
{
    // Some code that might throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex) when (ex.InnerException is TimeoutException)
{
    // Handle exceptions with TimeoutException as inner exception
}
catch (Exception ex) when (ex.InnerException is ArgumentException)
{
    // Handle exceptions with ArgumentException as inner exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Catch all other exceptions
}
```

### Custom Exception Types
Creating custom exception types allows you to define more specific exceptions for your application domain.

```csharp
public class MyCustomException : Exception
{
    public MyCustomException(string message) : base(message)
    {
    }

    public MyCustomException(string message, Exception innerException) : base(message, innerException)
    {
    }
}
```

### Async Exception Handling
When working with asynchronous code, you need to handle exceptions that occur asynchronously.

```csharp
try
{
    await SomeAsyncMethod();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
```

### Global Exception Handling
You can set up a global exception handler to catch unhandled exceptions across your application.

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += (sender, e) =>
    {
        Exception ex = (Exception)e.ExceptionObject;
        Console.WriteLine($"Unhandled exception: {ex.Message}");
    };

    // Your application code
}
```

### Using `finally` Block
The `finally` block is executed whether or not an exception is thrown, allowing you to perform cleanup operations.

```csharp
try
{
    // Some code that might throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
finally
{
    // Cleanup code, like closing connections or releasing resources
}
```

### Using `using` Statement
The `using` statement ensures that disposable objects are properly disposed of, even if an exception occurs.

```csharp
using (var resource = new SomeDisposableResource())
{
    // Code that uses the resource
}
```

These are some advanced exception handling techniques you can use in .NET Core C#. They help you write more robust and maintainable code by properly handling exceptions and managing resources. Let me know if you need further clarification or more examples!
