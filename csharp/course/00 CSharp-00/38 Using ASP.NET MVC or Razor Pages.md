ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages are two popular frameworks for building web applications with .NET Core C#. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **ASP.NET MVC**:
   - ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building web applications following the MVC architectural pattern.
   - It separates the application into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic).
   - Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, process user input, and return appropriate responses.
   - Views contain the UI markup and are responsible for rendering HTML content.
   - Models represent the data and business logic of the application.
   - ASP.NET MVC provides features like routing, filters, validation, and dependency injection.

2. **Razor Pages**:
   - Razor Pages is a framework for building web applications with a simpler and more page-focused approach compared to ASP.NET MVC.
   - It emphasizes convention over configuration and reduces ceremony by providing a more streamlined development experience.
   - Each Razor Page corresponds to a single URL endpoint and combines the UI markup (HTML) and backend logic (C#) in a single file.
   - Razor Pages use the Razor syntax for embedding C# code within HTML markup, making it easy to work with both UI and backend logic in the same file.
   - Razor Pages provide features like routing, dependency injection, page handlers, and code-behind files for separating UI and backend logic.

Choosing between ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages depends on the specific requirements and preferences of your project:

- **ASP.NET MVC** is well-suited for larger applications with complex navigation, multiple controllers, and more granular control over the application's structure.
- **Razor Pages** is ideal for simpler applications or scenarios where each page can be self-contained, with less emphasis on separate controllers and views.

Both ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages are supported and actively maintained by Microsoft, and you can choose the framework that best fits your project's needs. Additionally, you can mix and match ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages within the same project if desired, as they both run on top of the same ASP.NET Core runtime.
