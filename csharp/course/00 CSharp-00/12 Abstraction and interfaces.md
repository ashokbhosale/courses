Abstraction and interfaces are fundamental concepts in C# and .NET Core that promote flexibility, modularity, and maintainability in object-oriented programming. Here's an overview of abstraction and interfaces:

1. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
   - It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, simplifying the complexity of the system.
   - Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces in C#.
   - Abstract classes may contain abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation), allowing derived classes to provide specific implementations for the abstract methods.
   - Interfaces define a contract for classes to implement, specifying a set of methods and properties that must be present in implementing classes without providing any implementation details.
   - Abstraction helps in achieving loose coupling and high cohesion in software design, making the code more modular and easier to maintain and extend.

2. **Interfaces**:
   - An interface is a reference type in C# that defines a contract for classes to implement.
   - It contains only method and property declarations without any implementation.
   - Interfaces allow multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.
   - Classes that implement an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods and properties declared in the interface.
   - Interfaces are useful for defining common behavior across different classes, enabling polymorphism and providing a way to achieve dependency inversion in software design.
   - They are widely used in .NET Core for defining APIs, service contracts, and plugin architectures.

Example:

```csharp
// Interface definition
public interface IShape
{
    void Draw(); // Method declaration
}

// Class implementing the interface
public class Circle : IShape
{
    public void Draw() // Implementation of the interface method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

// Another class implementing the interface
public class Rectangle : IShape
{
    public void Draw() // Implementation of the interface method
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}
```

In this example, `IShape` is an interface defining a contract with a `Draw()` method. Both `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes implement the `IShape` interface by providing concrete implementations for the `Draw()` method.

Abstraction and interfaces play a crucial role in achieving decoupling, flexibility, and maintainability in C# and .NET Core applications by allowing for modular design and enabling polymorphism and dependency injection.
