In C#, operators are symbols that perform operations on operands, and expressions are combinations of operators, operands, and method calls that produce a single value. Here's an overview of operators and expressions in C# .NET Core:

### Operators:

C# supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and conditional operators. Here are some common operators:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - `+` (Addition)
   - `-` (Subtraction)
   - `*` (Multiplication)
   - `/` (Division)
   - `%` (Modulus)

2. **Relational Operators**:
   - `==` (Equality)
   - `!=` (Inequality)
   - `>` (Greater than)
   - `<` (Less than)
   - `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
   - `<=` (Less than or equal to)

3. **Logical Operators**:
   - `&&` (Logical AND)
   - `||` (Logical OR)
   - `!` (Logical NOT)

4. **Assignment Operators**:
   - `=` (Assignment)
   - `+=` (Addition assignment)
   - `-=` (Subtraction assignment)
   - `*=` (Multiplication assignment)
   - `/=` (Division assignment)
   - `%=` (Modulus assignment)

5. **Increment and Decrement Operators**:
   - `++` (Increment)
   - `--` (Decrement)

6. **Conditional Operator**:
   - `? :` (Conditional or ternary operator)

### Expressions:

An expression is a combination of one or more operands and operators that evaluates to a single value. Expressions can include variables, literals, method calls, and other expressions. Here are some examples of expressions:

```csharp
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int z = x + y; // Arithmetic expression
bool result = (x > y) && (x < 20); // Logical expression
string message = (x > y) ? "x is greater than y" : "x is not greater than y"; // Conditional expression
```

### Operator Precedence:

Operators in C# have precedence, which determines the order in which they are evaluated within an expression. For example, multiplication (`*`) has higher precedence than addition (`+`), so in the expression `2 + 3 * 4`, the multiplication operation will be performed first.

### Operator Associativity:

Operators in C# also have associativity, which determines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated. For example, the addition operator (`+`) is left-associative, so in the expression `10 + 5 + 3`, the addition operations will be performed from left to right.

### Example:

```csharp
int x = 10;
int y = 5;
int z = x + y * 2; // z will be 20 (5 * 2 = 10, 10 + 10 = 20)
bool result = (x > y) && (x < 20); // result will be true
```

Understanding operators and expressions is fundamental to writing effective C# code. By leveraging operators and expressions effectively, you can perform various calculations, comparisons, and logical operations in your programs.
