In C#, classes are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). They are used to define the blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of classes. Here's an overview of classes and objects in C# .NET Core:

### Classes:

A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of that type. Classes in C# can contain fields, properties, methods, constructors, events, indexers, operators, and nested types.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
[access-modifier] class ClassName
{
    // Fields (member variables)
    [access-modifier] dataType fieldName;

    // Properties
    [access-modifier] dataType PropertyName { get; set; }

    // Methods
    [access-modifier] returnType MethodName(parameters)
    {
        // Method body
    }

    // Constructors
    [access-modifier] ClassName(parameters)
    {
        // Constructor body
    }
    // Other members...
}
```

#### Example:
```csharp
public class Person
{
    // Fields
    public string Name;
    public int Age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    // Method
    public void DisplayInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Age: {Age}");
    }
}
```

### Objects:

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific realization of the class blueprint, with its own set of data values and behaviors. Objects are created from classes using the `new` keyword.

#### Syntax:
```csharp
ClassName objectName = new ClassName(arguments);
```

#### Example:
```csharp
Person person1 = new Person("John", 30);
```

In this example, `person1` is an object of the `Person` class. We create it using the `new` keyword followed by the class name and constructor arguments.

### Access Modifiers:

Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of classes and their members. Common access modifiers include `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, and `protected internal`.

### Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (fields) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It helps to hide the internal implementation details of a class from external code, promoting code reusability, and maintainability.

### Inheritance:

Inheritance is a mechanism in which a class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behavior from another class (base class or parent class). It promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of hierarchies of related classes.

### Polymorphism:

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables methods to be invoked on objects without knowing their specific types, promoting flexibility and extensibility in code.

### Summary:

Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in C# and object-oriented programming. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are instances of classes that represent specific data and behaviors in a program. Understanding classes and objects is essential for building modular, reusable, and maintainable software in C# .NET Core.
