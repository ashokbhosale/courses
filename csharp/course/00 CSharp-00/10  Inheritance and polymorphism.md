Inheritance and polymorphism are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, including in C# .NET Core. Let's break down each concept:

1. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit properties, methods, and other members from another class, called the base class or parent class. In C#, you can achieve inheritance using the `:` symbol followed by the name of the base class. 

    ```csharp
    // Base class
    public class Animal
    {
        public virtual void MakeSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Some generic sound");
        }
    }

    // Derived class
    public class Dog : Animal
    {
        public override void MakeSound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
        }
    }
    ```

    Here, the `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class. It inherits the `MakeSound` method and can override it with its own implementation.

2. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In the context of inheritance, polymorphism allows a derived class to override methods of its base class, providing specific implementations while still being treated as instances of the base class. 

    ```csharp
    Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
    myAnimal.MakeSound(); // Outputs: "Woof!"
    ```

    Even though `myAnimal` is of type `Animal`, because it's actually an instance of `Dog`, when `MakeSound()` is called, it invokes the overridden method from the `Dog` class.

Polymorphism in C# can also be achieved through interfaces, allowing unrelated classes to implement the same set of methods. This enhances flexibility and code reusability.

```csharp
public interface IShape
{
    double CalculateArea();
}

public class Rectangle : IShape
{
    public double Length { get; set; }
    public double Width { get; set; }

    public double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Length * Width;
    }
}

public class Circle : IShape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * Math.Pow(Radius, 2);
    }
}
```

In this example, both `Rectangle` and `Circle` implement the `IShape` interface, but each provides its own implementation of the `CalculateArea` method. This allows them to be treated polymorphically when interacting with them through the interface reference.


polymorphism notes
one thing many form
	1.static polymorhpism ,method and operator overloading
2. dynamic polyphism :- method overriding (virtual override)
3. object to take different form
base class ref => when point to baseclass it can call base class method
				when it points to child class, it will call child class method.
4. with interface one method can implemented in different way with multiple inheritance in two or more child /derived class.
5. new keyword in child class , for overriding method scenario


Different type of inheritance and polymorphism in C# .net core

In C#, inheritance and polymorphism are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that facilitate code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility. Here's an overview of inheritance and polymorphism in C# .NET Core:

1. **Inheritance**:
   - Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can acquire the properties and behavior (methods) of another class. 
   - The class that inherits is called the derived class or subclass, and the class being inherited from is called the base class or superclass.
   - In C#, you use the colon (:) symbol to denote inheritance when defining a class. For example:
     ```csharp
     public class Animal { ... }

     public class Dog : Animal { ... }
     ```
   - The derived class inherits all members (fields, properties, methods) of the base class, except constructors and destructors. It can also add its own members and override inherited members.

2. **Types of Inheritance**:
   - **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from only one base class.
   - **Multilevel Inheritance**: A derived class is created from another derived class.
   - **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.
   - **Multiple Inheritance** (not supported in C#): A class inherits from more than one base class. C# doesn't support this directly, but you can achieve similar behavior using interfaces.

3. **Polymorphism**:
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type.
   - In C#, polymorphism is primarily achieved through method overriding and method overloading.
   - **Method Overriding**: A derived class can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. This allows a method to behave differently for objects of different classes.
   - **Method Overloading**: Multiple methods can have the same name but different signatures (different parameters) within the same class. The appropriate method is called based on the arguments passed at the time of invocation.

4. **Examples**:
   - **Method Overriding**:
     ```csharp
     public class Animal
     {
         public virtual void MakeSound()
         {
             Console.WriteLine("Some generic sound");
         }
     }

     public class Dog : Animal
     {
         public override void MakeSound()
         {
             Console.WriteLine("Woof!");
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Polymorphism**:
     ```csharp
     Animal animal = new Dog();
     animal.MakeSound(); // Output: "Woof!"
     ```
   - Here, the `MakeSound()` method is overridden in the `Dog` class, and when calling `MakeSound()` through a reference of type `Animal` pointing to a `Dog` object, the overridden method in the `Dog` class is invoked.

In summary, inheritance and polymorphism are powerful concepts in C# that enable code reuse, flexibility, and the creation of extensible software systems. They are essential pillars of object-oriented programming paradigms.
