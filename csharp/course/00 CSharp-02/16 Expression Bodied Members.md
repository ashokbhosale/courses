Expression-bodied members in .NET Core C# provide a concise syntax for writing methods, properties, indexers, and other members. They allow you to define members using lambda-like syntax, which can make your code more readable and expressive. Here's how you can use expression-bodied members in .NET Core C#:

### 1. Methods:

Expression-bodied methods allow you to define methods using lambda-like syntax.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    // Expression-bodied method
    public int Calculate(int x, int y) => x + y;
}
```

### 2. Properties:

Expression-bodied properties allow you to define properties using lambda-like syntax.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private int _value;

    // Expression-bodied property
    public int Value
    {
        get => _value;
        set => _value = value;
    }
}
```

### 3. Indexers:

Expression-bodied indexers allow you to define indexers using lambda-like syntax.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private List<string> _data = new List<string>();

    // Expression-bodied indexer
    public string this[int index] => _data[index];
}
```

### 4. Constructors:

Expression-bodied constructors are not directly supported, as constructors cannot return values. However, you can use them indirectly in certain scenarios, such as with read-only properties.

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private readonly int _value;

    // Constructor indirectly using expression-bodied property
    public MyClass(int value) => _value = value;

    // Expression-bodied property
    public int Value => _value;
}
```

### 5. Final Thoughts:

Expression-bodied members provide a concise and expressive way to define methods, properties, indexers, and other members in .NET Core C#. By using expression-bodied members, you can write more readable and maintainable code in your .NET Core projects. Let me know if you need further assistance or examples!
