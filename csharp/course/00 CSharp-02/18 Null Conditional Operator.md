The null conditional operator (`?.`) in .NET Core C# provides a concise way to check for null references and safely access members of an object without causing a null reference exception. It simplifies code and improves readability by reducing the need for explicit null checks. Here's how you can use the null conditional operator in .NET Core C#:

### Syntax:

The null conditional operator (`?.`) is used to access members of an object only if the object itself is not null. If the object is null, the expression returns null instead of throwing a null reference exception.

```csharp
object?.Member
```

### Example:

```csharp
List<int> numbers = null;

// Without null conditional operator (may throw NullReferenceException)
int count = numbers.Count;

// With null conditional operator (safe access)
int? countSafe = numbers?.Count;
```

### Chaining:

You can chain multiple null conditional operators together to access nested members of an object hierarchy safely.

```csharp
string result = customer?.Address?.City;
```

### Method Invocation:

You can also use the null conditional operator to safely invoke methods on nullable objects.

```csharp
string name = GetCustomer()?.Name;
```

### Null Coalescing Operator:

The null conditional operator can be combined with the null coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value if the result of the expression is null.

```csharp
string result = customer?.Name ?? "Unknown";
```

### Summary:

The null conditional operator (`?.`) in .NET Core C# provides a concise and safe way to access members of an object hierarchy without risking null reference exceptions. By using the null conditional operator, you can write cleaner and more robust code in your .NET Core projects. Let me know if you need further assistance or examples!
