In .NET Core C#, nullable value types allow you to assign null to value types such as int, float, and struct, which typically cannot store null. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to represent the absence of a value. Here's how nullable value types work:

### 1. Nullable Value Types Declaration:

You can declare a nullable value type by appending a question mark `?` to the type's declaration. For example:

```csharp
int? nullableInt = null;
float? nullableFloat = 3.14f;
bool? nullableBool = true;
```

### 2. Checking for Null:

You can check if a nullable value type has a value or is null using the `HasValue` property or by comparing it directly to null.

```csharp
if (nullableInt.HasValue)
{
    // Nullable int has a value
}
else
{
    // Nullable int is null
}

if (nullableFloat == null)
{
    // Nullable float is null
}
```

### 3. Accessing the Value:

You can access the value of a nullable value type using the `Value` property. However, make sure to check if it has a value before accessing it to avoid a `System.InvalidOperationException` if it's null.

```csharp
int? nullableInt = 10;

if (nullableInt != null)
{
    int value = nullableInt.Value; // Accessing the value
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the null-coalescing operator `??` to provide a default value if the nullable value type is null:

```csharp
int valueOrDefault = nullableInt ?? -1; // Assign -1 if nullableInt is null
```

### 4. Nullable Value Types in Database Interactions:

Nullable value types are commonly used in database operations, especially when working with databases that allow null values for certain columns. Entity Framework Core (EF Core) and other ORMs handle nullable value types seamlessly when mapping database columns to C# properties.

### Summary:

Nullable value types in .NET Core C# allow you to represent value types with a null value, enabling you to express the absence of a value in addition to their regular non-nullable values. By understanding how to declare, check for null, and access the value of nullable value types, you can effectively work with scenarios where nullability is required.
