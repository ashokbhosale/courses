Dynamic typing in .NET Core C# allows you to work with objects whose types are not known at compile time. This provides flexibility when interacting with dynamic languages, COM objects, or situations where the type is determined at runtime. Here's how you can use dynamic typing in .NET Core C#:

### 1. `dynamic` Keyword:

The `dynamic` keyword is used to declare variables whose types are resolved at runtime instead of compile time. 

```csharp
dynamic dynamicVariable = GetValueFromExternalSource(); // The type is determined at runtime
```

### 2. Dynamic Binding:

When you use a dynamic variable, the compiler defers type checking until runtime. This allows you to call methods and access properties that are not known at compile time.

```csharp
dynamic dynamicVariable = GetDynamicObject();
dynamicVariable.SomeMethod(); // Calls a method that may or may not exist
dynamicVariable.SomeProperty = 42; // Sets a property that may or may not exist
```

### 3. Late Binding:

Dynamic typing enables late binding, where method invocations and property accesses are resolved at runtime rather than compile time. This can lead to runtime errors if the accessed members do not exist or have incompatible signatures.

### 4. COM Interoperability:

Dynamic typing is commonly used when working with COM objects, as it allows you to interact with COM interfaces without requiring explicit casting or interface definitions.

```csharp
dynamic comObject = GetCOMObject();
comObject.MethodFromCOM(); // Calls a method from a COM interface
```

### 5. Limitations:

- Dynamic typing sacrifices compile-time type safety, leading to potential runtime errors if methods or properties do not exist.
  
- Performance may be impacted compared to statically-typed code due to runtime type resolution.

### 6. Use Cases:

- Interacting with dynamic languages like JavaScript in .NET Core applications.
  
- Working with COM objects or dynamic libraries.
  
- Simplifying code when dealing with complex or dynamic data structures.

### Summary:

Dynamic typing in .NET Core C# provides flexibility when working with types whose structure is determined at runtime. By using the `dynamic` keyword, you can defer type resolution until runtime, enabling interactions with dynamic languages, COM objects, or situations where compile-time type checking is not feasible. However, it's important to use dynamic typing judiciously, as it can lead to runtime errors and decreased performance. Let me know if you need further assistance or examples!
