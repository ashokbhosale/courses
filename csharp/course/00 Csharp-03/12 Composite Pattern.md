### Composite Pattern

#### Intent and Motivation:
The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly by defining a common interface for both. The main intent of the Composite pattern is to represent hierarchical relationships between objects in a recursive manner, allowing clients to work with complex structures of objects in a unified way.

The motivation behind the Composite pattern is to provide a unified way to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects, where individual objects and compositions of objects can be treated interchangeably. By defining a common interface for both leaf and composite objects, the Composite pattern promotes code reuse, flexibility, and scalability. It simplifies client code by eliminating the need for conditional logic to handle different types of objects in the hierarchy.

#### Tree Structure and Component Hierarchy:
In the Composite pattern, objects are organized into tree structures consisting of nodes and leaves. Each node in the tree represents a composite object that can contain other nodes or leaves, forming a hierarchical relationship. Leaf nodes represent individual objects that do not have any children. The composite objects and leaf objects share a common interface, allowing them to be treated uniformly by clients.

#### Implementation Techniques:
The Composite pattern can be implemented using the following techniques:

1. **Component Interface or Base Class**: Define a common interface or base class that represents both leaf and composite objects in the hierarchy. This interface should declare operations that are common to both types of objects, such as adding, removing, or accessing child components.

2. **Leaf and Composite Classes**: Implement concrete leaf and composite classes that represent individual objects and compositions of objects, respectively. Leaf classes implement the component interface for individual objects, while composite classes implement the same interface and also contain collections of child components.

#### Use Cases and Examples with .NET Core C#:
The Composite pattern is commonly used in scenarios where you need to represent hierarchical structures of objects, such as GUI components, file systems, organizational charts, or mathematical expressions. Some common use cases and examples in .NET Core C# include:

- **GUI Component Hierarchies**: Representing nested structures of GUI components, such as windows, panels, buttons, and labels, to build complex user interfaces.
- **File System Representations**: Modeling directory structures and files in a file system, where directories can contain other directories or files.
- **Mathematical Expression Trees**: Building expression trees for mathematical formulas, where operators and operands can be nested recursively to represent complex expressions.

Example:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Component interface
public interface IComponent
{
    void Operation();
}

// Leaf class
public class Leaf : IComponent
{
    private readonly string _name;

    public Leaf(string name)
    {
        _name = name;
    }

    public void Operation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Leaf {_name} operation");
    }
}

// Composite class
public class Composite : IComponent
{
    private readonly List<IComponent> _children = new List<IComponent>();

    public void Add(IComponent component)
    {
        _children.Add(component);
    }

    public void Remove(IComponent component)
    {
        _children.Remove(component);
    }

    public void Operation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Composite operation");
        foreach (var child in _children)
        {
            child.Operation();
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client
{
    public void Run(IComponent component)
    {
        component.Operation();
    }
}

// Usage
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Create leaf components
        var leaf1 = new Leaf("1");
        var leaf2 = new Leaf("2");
        var leaf3 = new Leaf("3");

        // Create composite component and add leaf components
        var composite1 = new Composite();
        composite1.Add(leaf1);
        composite1.Add(leaf2);

        // Create another composite component and add composite1 and leaf3
        var composite2 = new Composite();
        composite2.Add(composite1);
        composite2.Add(leaf3);

        // Execute operations
        var client = new Client();
        client.Run(composite2);
    }
}
```

In this example, the Composite pattern is used to represent a hierarchical structure of objects consisting of leaf (`Leaf`) and composite (`Composite`) components. Leaf objects represent individual elements, while composite objects represent collections of elements. The client code (`Client`) treats both leaf and composite objects uniformly through the common `IComponent` interface, allowing complex structures to be traversed and operated on recursively.
