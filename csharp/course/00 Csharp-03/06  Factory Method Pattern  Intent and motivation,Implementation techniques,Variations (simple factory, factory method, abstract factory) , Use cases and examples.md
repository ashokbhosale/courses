### Factory Method Pattern

#### Intent and Motivation:
The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It encapsulates object creation logic in a separate method, allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation of this method to create objects of different types.

The main motivation behind the Factory Method pattern is to promote loose coupling between classes and provide a way to defer object creation to subclasses. This enables better code maintainability, extensibility, and testability, as it allows new object types to be introduced without modifying existing code.

#### Implementation Techniques:
There are several techniques to implement the Factory Method pattern in C# .NET Core:

1. **Simple Factory**:
   A simple factory is not a design pattern in itself, but rather a static method or class responsible for creating instances of different types based on input parameters. While it provides a centralized point for object creation, it violates the Open/Closed Principle since it requires modification whenever a new product type is introduced.
   
2. **Factory Method**:
   In the Factory Method pattern, a superclass declares an abstract method for creating objects, which subclasses implement to provide specific object instantiation logic. This allows subclasses to define the type of objects they create while adhering to a common interface defined by the superclass.
   
3. **Abstract Factory**:
   The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It defines a set of factory methods, each responsible for creating a different type of product. This pattern promotes the creation of cohesive object families and ensures that the created objects are compatible with each other.

#### Variations (Simple Factory, Factory Method, Abstract Factory):
- **Simple Factory**: A static method or class responsible for creating instances of different types based on input parameters. It does not provide flexibility for object creation and violates the Open/Closed Principle.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects in a superclass, allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation for creating specific types of objects.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates multiple factory methods, each responsible for creating a different type of product.

#### Use Cases and Examples in .NET Core C#:
- **Simple Factory**: A simple factory can be used when the object creation logic is straightforward and unlikely to change frequently. For example, a logger factory that creates instances of different types of loggers (e.g., file logger, database logger, console logger) based on a configuration setting.
- **Factory Method**: The Factory Method pattern is suitable when you have a superclass defining an interface for creating objects, but subclasses need to provide their own implementations for creating specific types of objects. For example, an abstract `Document` class with a `Create` method that returns a specific type of document (e.g., `Resume`, `Report`) implemented by subclasses.
- **Abstract Factory**: The Abstract Factory pattern is useful when you need to create families of related or dependent objects. For example, a GUI toolkit that provides different types of UI elements (e.g., buttons, text boxes, checkboxes) with each supported platform (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) having its own concrete factory implementation.

Example (Factory Method):
```csharp
// Product interface
public interface IProduct
{
    void Operation();
}

// Concrete product
public class ConcreteProductA : IProduct
{
    public void Operation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Operation on product A");
    }
}

// Concrete product
public class ConcreteProductB : IProduct
{
    public void Operation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Operation on product B");
    }
}

// Creator abstract class
public abstract class Creator
{
    public abstract IProduct FactoryMethod();
    
    public void AnOperation()
    {
        var product = FactoryMethod();
        product.Operation();
    }
}

// Concrete creator
public class ConcreteCreatorA : Creator
{
    public override IProduct FactoryMethod()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductA();
    }
}

// Concrete creator
public class ConcreteCreatorB : Creator
{
    public override IProduct FactoryMethod()
    {
        return new ConcreteProductB();
    }
}

// Usage
var creatorA = new ConcreteCreatorA();
creatorA.AnOperation(); // Output: Operation on product A

var creatorB = new ConcreteCreatorB();
creatorB.AnOperation(); // Output: Operation on product B
```

In this example, the Factory Method pattern is used to create different types of products (`ConcreteProductA`, `ConcreteProductB`) through concrete creator classes (`ConcreteCreatorA`, `ConcreteCreatorB`). Each concrete creator provides its own implementation of the `FactoryMethod` to instantiate a specific product type.
