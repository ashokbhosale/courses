### Template Method Pattern

#### Intent and Motivation:
The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. It aims to provide a template for an algorithm and allow subclasses to customize certain steps while preserving the overall algorithm structure. This pattern promotes code reuse, reduces duplication, and ensures consistency in the algorithm's behavior across subclasses.

The motivation behind the Template Method pattern is to encapsulate the common behavior of an algorithm in a superclass, providing a foundation for subclasses to build upon. By defining a template method with fixed steps and optional hooks for customization, the pattern allows for flexible and extensible algorithm design. This approach enhances maintainability, as changes made to the algorithm can be localized to the superclass without affecting its subclasses.

#### Defining Skeleton of an Algorithm:
In the Template Method pattern, the algorithm's structure is defined in a superclass as a series of steps, with some steps being abstract or providing default implementations. Subclasses can then override these steps to tailor the algorithm's behavior to their specific needs, while adhering to the overall structure dictated by the superclass.

#### Implementation Techniques:
To implement the Template Method pattern in .NET Core C#, you can follow these techniques:

1. **Abstract Class with Template Method**: Create an abstract class that contains the template method, which defines the algorithm's steps. The template method calls primitive operations or hooks that subclasses can override.

2. **Concrete Subclasses**: Define concrete subclasses that extend the abstract class and provide implementations for the abstract methods or hooks. Each subclass can customize the algorithm by overriding specific steps as needed.

3. **Common Functionality**: Identify common functionality shared by subclasses and encapsulate it in the template method. This ensures that the core logic of the algorithm remains consistent across subclasses.

#### Use Cases and Examples:
The Template Method pattern is suitable for scenarios where you need to define a common algorithm with variations in specific steps. Some common use cases include:

- **Algorithm Design**: Providing a framework for executing complex algorithms with predefined steps but customizable behavior.
  
- **Workflow Management**: Implementing workflows or processes with standardized steps but variations in specific tasks or actions.
  
- **Code Generation**: Generating code or artifacts based on a predefined template structure, with customization options for specific sections.

Example:
```csharp
using System;

// Abstract class defining the template method
public abstract class AlgorithmTemplate
{
    // Template method defining the algorithm's steps
    public void ExecuteAlgorithm()
    {
        Step1();
        Step2();
        Step3();
    }

    // Abstract methods or hooks for subclasses to override
    protected abstract void Step1();
    protected abstract void Step2();

    // Default implementation of a step
    protected virtual void Step3()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Default implementation of Step3");
    }
}

// Concrete subclass implementing specific steps
public class ConcreteAlgorithm : AlgorithmTemplate
{
    protected override void Step1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Implementing Step1");
    }

    protected override void Step2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Implementing Step2");
    }

    // Optionally override Step3 to customize behavior
    protected override void Step3()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Custom implementation of Step3");
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client
{
    public void Main()
    {
        // Create an instance of the concrete subclass
        var algorithm = new ConcreteAlgorithm();

        // Execute the algorithm
        algorithm.ExecuteAlgorithm();
    }
}

// Usage
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var client = new Client();
        client.Main();
    }
}
```

In this example, `AlgorithmTemplate` represents the abstract class defining the template method `ExecuteAlgorithm` with three steps. `ConcreteAlgorithm` extends `AlgorithmTemplate` and provides implementations for `Step1` and `Step2`, while optionally overriding `Step3`. Clients can create instances of `ConcreteAlgorithm` and execute the algorithm, with the option to customize specific steps as needed.
