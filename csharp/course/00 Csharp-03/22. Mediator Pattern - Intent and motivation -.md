### Mediator Pattern

#### Intent and Motivation:
The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling by centralizing complex communication and control logic between multiple objects. It defines an object (the mediator) that encapsulates the interaction between objects, allowing them to communicate with each other without being directly coupled. The main intent of the Mediator pattern is to reduce the dependencies between objects and facilitate the exchange of information in a more flexible and maintainable way.

The motivation behind the Mediator pattern is to address the issues of tight coupling and spaghetti code that can arise when objects directly communicate with each other. By introducing a mediator object that acts as a hub for communication, the pattern promotes encapsulation, decouples the participating objects, and simplifies the maintenance and evolution of the system. This enables better separation of concerns and improves the overall modularity and extensibility of the codebase.

#### Centralizing Complex Communications and Control:
In the Mediator pattern, there are several key components:

- **Mediator**: Defines an interface or abstract class for communicating with colleague objects. It encapsulates the communication logic and controls the interaction between colleagues.

- **Colleague**: Represents an object that communicates with other objects through the mediator. Colleagues are unaware of each other and only interact with the mediator to exchange information.

#### Implementation Techniques:
To implement the Mediator pattern in .NET Core C#, you can follow these techniques:

1. **Mediator Interface or Abstract Class**: Define a mediator interface or abstract class that declares methods for communication between colleagues. This interface should encapsulate the complex communication and control logic.

2. **Concrete Mediator**: Implement a concrete mediator class that provides the actual implementation of the mediator interface. The concrete mediator maintains references to colleague objects and orchestrates their interaction.

3. **Colleague Interface or Abstract Class**: Define a colleague interface or abstract class that declares methods for interacting with the mediator. Colleagues use these methods to send and receive messages through the mediator.

4. **Concrete Colleague**: Implement concrete colleague classes that represent individual objects participating in the interaction. Colleagues interact with the mediator by calling its methods and receive notifications from other colleagues through the mediator.

#### Use Cases and Examples:
The Mediator pattern is suitable for scenarios where multiple objects need to communicate with each other in a complex and dynamic way, without direct dependencies between them. Some common use cases include:

- **GUI Components**: Managing interactions between user interface components in a graphical application, such as dialogs, buttons, and text fields.

- **Message Brokers**: Implementing message brokers or event buses in distributed systems, where components need to publish and subscribe to events without direct coupling.

- **Flight Control Systems**: Coordinating the interactions between different components of a flight control system, such as sensors, actuators, and autopilot systems.

Example:
```csharp
using System;

// Mediator interface
public interface IMediator
{
    void Send(string message, Colleague colleague);
}

// Concrete mediator
public class ConcreteMediator : IMediator
{
    public void Send(string message, Colleague colleague)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Message '{message}' sent by {colleague.GetType().Name}");
    }
}

// Colleague interface
public abstract class Colleague
{
    protected readonly IMediator _mediator;

    public Colleague(IMediator mediator)
    {
        _mediator = mediator;
    }

    public abstract void Send(string message);
    public abstract void Receive(string message);
}

// Concrete colleague
public class ConcreteColleague1 : Colleague
{
    public ConcreteColleague1(IMediator mediator) : base(mediator) { }

    public override void Send(string message)
    {
        _mediator.Send(message, this);
    }

    public override void Receive(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Message '{message}' received by ConcreteColleague1");
    }
}

// Concrete colleague
public class ConcreteColleague2 : Colleague
{
    public ConcreteColleague2(IMediator mediator) : base(mediator) { }

    public override void Send(string message)
    {
        _mediator.Send(message, this);
    }

    public override void Receive(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Message '{message}' received by ConcreteColleague2");
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client
{
    public void Main()
    {
        // Create mediator
        var mediator = new ConcreteMediator();

        // Create colleagues
        var colleague1 = new ConcreteColleague1(mediator);
        var colleague2 = new ConcreteColleague2(mediator);

        // Send messages through mediator
        colleague1.Send("Hello from colleague1");
        colleague2.Send("Hi from colleague2");
    }
}

// Usage
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var client = new Client();
        client.Main();
    }
}
```

In this example, the Mediator pattern is used to facilitate communication between two colleagues (`ConcreteColleague1` and `ConcreteColleague2`) through a mediator (`ConcreteMediator`). Colleagues interact with each other indirectly by sending messages through the mediator, which orchestrates the communication and ensures loose coupling between objects. This enables better separation of concerns and promotes modularity and flexibility in the system design.
