**Understanding DRY Principle:**

The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle is a software development principle aimed at reducing repetition and redundancy in code. It emphasizes that every piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, unambiguous representation within a system. The DRY principle helps improve code maintainability, readability, and scalability by avoiding duplication, which reduces the risk of errors and makes it easier to make changes.

**Benefits of DRY Principle:**

1. **Code Maintenance:** DRY code is easier to maintain because changes only need to be made in one place, rather than multiple places where duplication exists.
2. **Readability:** DRY code is more readable because developers don't have to navigate through multiple instances of duplicated code.
3. **Scalability:** DRY code is more scalable because adding new features or making modifications is simpler and less error-prone.
4. **Reduced Errors:** DRY code reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies that can arise from maintaining multiple copies of the same logic.

**Techniques for Eliminating Duplication in Code:**

1. **Extracting Common Functionality:** Identify repeated code patterns and extract them into reusable functions or methods.
2. **Using Functions and Methods:** Write functions and methods to encapsulate common functionality, allowing it to be reused across multiple parts of the codebase.
3. **Parameterization:** Use parameters to generalize functionality so that it can be applied in different contexts without duplication.
4. **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Use inheritance and polymorphism to avoid duplicating code across similar classes by defining common behavior in a base class or interface.
5. **Template Methods:** Use template methods to define a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allow subclasses to override specific steps as needed.
6. **DRY Tools:** Use linting tools or static code analysis tools to identify and eliminate duplication automatically.

**Applying DRY Principle in C#:**

```csharp
// Example of duplicating logic in two places
public class Calculation
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int Subtract(int a, int b)
    {
        return a - b;
    }

    public int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }

    public int Divide(int a, int b)
    {
        if (b == 0)
        {
            throw new DivideByZeroException("Cannot divide by zero.");
        }
        return a / b;
    }

    public double CalculateAverage(int[] numbers)
    {
        int sum = 0;
        foreach (int num in numbers)
        {
            sum += num;
        }
        return (double)sum / numbers.Length;
    }
}
```

In the above code, the logic for calculating the sum of numbers and then calculating the average is duplicated within the `CalculateAverage` method.

To apply the DRY principle, we can refactor the code as follows:

```csharp
// Refactored code using extracted method to avoid duplication
public class Calculation
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int Subtract(int a, int b)
    {
        return a - b;
    }

    public int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }

    public int Divide(int a, int b)
    {
        if (b == 0)
        {
            throw new DivideByZeroException("Cannot divide by zero.");
        }
        return a / b;
    }

    public double CalculateAverage(int[] numbers)
    {
        int sum = CalculateSum(numbers);
        return (double)sum / numbers.Length;
    }

    private int CalculateSum(int[] numbers)
    {
        int sum = 0;
        foreach (int num in numbers)
        {
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In this refactored code, the logic for calculating the sum of numbers has been extracted into a separate private method `CalculateSum`, which is then reused within the `CalculateAverage` method. This eliminates duplication and adheres to the DRY principle.
