Integrating design principles with architectural styles like MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) in .NET Core C# applications is essential for creating scalable, maintainable, and testable software architectures. Let's explore how design principles can be integrated into these architectural styles along with patterns for scalable and maintainable architectures.

**Integrating Design Principles with Architectural Styles:**

1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller):**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensure that each component (Model, View, Controller) has a single responsibility. For example, the Model should handle data and business logic, the View should handle presentation logic, and the Controller should handle user interactions and orchestrate communication between the Model and View.
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Use abstractions and interfaces to allow for extension without modification. For instance, create interfaces for services and repositories, allowing different implementations to be swapped without changing the Controller or View code.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depend on abstractions, not concretions. Inject dependencies into Controllers and Views using Dependency Injection (DI) to achieve loose coupling and facilitate testing.

2. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Ensure that the ViewModel handles view logic and data-binding, while the Model manages data and business logic. This separation promotes maintainability and testability.
   - **Dependency Injection (DI):** Use DI to inject services and dependencies into ViewModels, allowing for easier unit testing and decoupling from concrete implementations.
   - **Data Binding:** Leverage data binding mechanisms provided by frameworks like WPF or Xamarin.Forms to establish communication between the View and ViewModel without tight coupling.

**Patterns for Scalable and Maintainable Architectures:**

1. **Repository Pattern:**
   - Use the Repository pattern to abstract data access and provide a clear separation between data access logic and business logic.
   - Implement interfaces for repositories, allowing for easy unit testing and swapping out data access implementations.

2. **Service Layer:**
   - Introduce a service layer to encapsulate complex business logic and orchestrate interactions between different parts of the application.
   - Keep Controllers or ViewModels lightweight by delegating business logic to service classes.

3. **Dependency Injection (DI):**
   - Embrace DI to inject dependencies into components, reducing coupling and facilitating testing and modularity.
   - Utilize the built-in DI container in .NET Core to configure and manage dependencies across the application.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):**
   - Implement an event-driven architecture to decouple components and promote scalability and extensibility.
   - Use messaging frameworks like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus to facilitate asynchronous communication between microservices or components.

**Example: Integrating SRP with MVC:**

```csharp
// Model
public class Order
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalAmount { get; set; }
    // Additional properties and methods related to order
}

// View
@model OrderViewModel

<div>
    Customer Name: @Model.CustomerName <br />
    Total Amount: @Model.TotalAmount <br />
    <!-- Additional HTML for order details -->
</div>

// Controller
public class OrderController : Controller
{
    private readonly IOrderService _orderService;

    public OrderController(IOrderService orderService)
    {
        _orderService = orderService;
    }

    public IActionResult Details(int id)
    {
        var order = _orderService.GetOrderById(id);
        var orderViewModel = new OrderViewModel
        {
            CustomerName = order.CustomerName,
            TotalAmount = order.TotalAmount
        };
        return View(orderViewModel);
    }
}
```

In this example, the MVC architecture separates concerns, with the Model handling data and business logic, the View handling presentation logic, and the Controller handling user interactions and orchestrating communication between the Model and View. The use of interfaces and dependency injection promotes adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), enabling maintainable and testable code.
