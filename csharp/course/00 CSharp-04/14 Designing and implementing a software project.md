Designing and implementing a software project that applies various design principles, including SOLID principles, requires careful planning, architecture design, and implementation. Let's outline a hypothetical project and discuss how design principles can be applied to it in .NET Core C#.

**Project Description:**
The project is a simple task management application called "TaskMaster" that allows users to create, update, delete, and prioritize tasks. The application will have a web-based user interface for interacting with tasks and will store task data in a database.

**Applying Design Principles:**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - Each class should have a single responsibility. For example:
     - `TaskService` class responsible for handling business logic related to tasks.
     - `TaskRepository` class responsible for database operations related to tasks.
     - `TaskController` class responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses related to tasks.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Design classes and components to be open for extension but closed for modification. For example:
     - Use interfaces for extensibility, allowing different implementations of repositories or services to be added without modifying existing code.
     - Implement a plugin system for task prioritization algorithms, allowing new algorithms to be added without changing existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes without affecting the behavior of the program. For example:
     - Subclasses of `Task` (e.g., `BugTask`, `FeatureTask`) should be substitutable for the base `Task` class wherever tasks are used.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. For example:
     - Define separate interfaces for different aspects of task management, such as `ITaskService`, `ITaskRepository`, and `ITaskPriorityStrategy`.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - Depend on abstractions, not concretions. For example:
     - Use dependency injection to inject dependencies into classes, allowing for loose coupling and easier testing.
     - Implement inversion of control (IoC) containers to manage dependencies and facilitate dependency injection.

**Project Architecture:**

- **Presentation Layer (Web Interface):**
  - MVC pattern for handling HTTP requests and responses.
  - View models to transfer data between the controller and views.
- **Application Layer (Business Logic):**
  - Service classes (e.g., `TaskService`) for handling business logic related to tasks.
- **Data Access Layer (Persistence):**
  - Repository classes (e.g., `TaskRepository`) for database operations related to tasks.
- **Infrastructure Layer:**
  - Database for storing task data.
  - IoC container for managing dependencies and facilitating dependency injection.

**Example Code Snippets:**

```csharp
// Task model
public class Task
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public Priority Priority { get; set; }
    // Additional properties and methods
}

// Task service interface
public interface ITaskService
{
    Task GetTaskById(int id);
    void CreateTask(Task task);
    void UpdateTask(Task task);
    void DeleteTask(int id);
}

// Task service implementation
public class TaskService : ITaskService
{
    private readonly ITaskRepository _taskRepository;

    public TaskService(ITaskRepository taskRepository)
    {
        _taskRepository = taskRepository;
    }

    public Task GetTaskById(int id)
    {
        return _taskRepository.GetTaskById(id);
    }

    // Implement other methods
}

// Task repository interface
public interface ITaskRepository
{
    Task GetTaskById(int id);
    void CreateTask(Task task);
    void UpdateTask(Task task);
    void DeleteTask(int id);
}

// Task repository implementation
public class TaskRepository : ITaskRepository
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;

    public TaskRepository(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public Task GetTaskById(int id)
    {
        return _dbContext.Tasks.Find(id);
    }

    // Implement other methods
}

// Task controller
public class TaskController : Controller
{
    private readonly ITaskService _taskService;

    public TaskController(ITaskService taskService)
    {
        _taskService = taskService;
    }

    public IActionResult Details(int id)
    {
        var task = _taskService.GetTaskById(id);
        return View(task);
    }

    // Implement other action methods
}
```

**Documentation and Presentation:**
Document the project architecture, design decisions, and implementation details using tools like Markdown, UML diagrams, and presentations. Present the project to stakeholders, discussing how design principles were applied, the rationale behind design decisions, and the benefits of the chosen architecture for scalability, maintainability, and testability.

By designing and implementing the "TaskMaster" application with a focus on design principles and best practices, you'll create a robust and maintainable software project that demonstrates your understanding of SOLID principles and design patterns in .NET Core C#.
