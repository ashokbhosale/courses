Certainly! Let's explore each SOLID principle with a corresponding example in .NET Core C#:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - **Example:** Consider a .NET Core web application with a `User` class. The `User` class should ideally be responsible only for managing user-related data and operations such as authentication, authorization, and profile management. Instead of having all these responsibilities in one class, you can split them into separate classes. For instance:
     ```csharp
     public class User
     {
         public string Username { get; set; }
         public string Password { get; set; }
         // User-related methods...
     }
     
     public class Authenticator
     {
         public bool Authenticate(string username, string password)
         {
             // Authentication logic...
         }
     }
     
     public class UserProfileManager
     {
         public UserProfile GetUserProfile(string username)
         {
             // Retrieve user profile logic...
         }
         // Other profile management methods...
     }
     ```
   Here, the `User` class focuses solely on representing user data, while `Authenticator` handles authentication logic and `UserProfileManager` deals with user profile management.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - **Example:** Consider an application that calculates the total price of products in a shopping cart. We can achieve the OCP by defining an interface `IProduct` and implementing it for different types of products, without changing existing code. For instance:
     ```csharp
     public interface IProduct
     {
         decimal GetPrice();
     }
     
     public class Book : IProduct
     {
         public decimal GetPrice()
         {
             // Book price calculation logic...
         }
     }
     
     public class ShoppingCart
     {
         public decimal CalculateTotalPrice(IEnumerable<IProduct> products)
         {
             decimal totalPrice = 0;
             foreach (var product in products)
             {
                 totalPrice += product.GetPrice();
             }
             return totalPrice;
         }
     }
     ```
   Here, `ShoppingCart` class is closed for modification because it doesn't need to change when new products are added. New products can be added by implementing `IProduct` interface without altering the `ShoppingCart` class.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - **Example:** Consider a .NET Core application with a `Rectangle` class and a `Square` class inheriting from `Rectangle`. According to LSP, any functionality that works with `Rectangle` should also work with `Square` without breaking the application's correctness.
     ```csharp
     public class Rectangle
     {
         public virtual int Width { get; set; }
         public virtual int Height { get; set; }
     
         public int GetArea()
         {
             return Width * Height;
         }
     }
     
     public class Square : Rectangle
     {
         public override int Width
         {
             set { base.Width = base.Height = value; }
         }
         public override int Height
         {
             set { base.Width = base.Height = value; }
         }
     }
     ```
   Here, although `Square` inherits from `Rectangle`, it behaves differently. However, it doesn't break the LSP because a `Square` can still be used interchangeably with a `Rectangle` in most contexts.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - **Example:** Consider a .NET Core interface `IWorker` representing workers in an organization. Instead of having a single large interface, it's better to segregate it into smaller interfaces based on specific responsibilities.
     ```csharp
     public interface IWorker
     {
         void Work();
         void TakeBreak();
     }
     
     public interface IWorkable
     {
         void Work();
     }
     
     public interface IBreakTaker
     {
         void TakeBreak();
     }
     ```
   This way, classes that only need to work or take breaks can implement the corresponding smaller interfaces, adhering to the ISP.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - **Example:** Consider a .NET Core application with a `NotificationService` class that sends notifications. Instead of directly instantiating dependencies, we can inject them using dependency injection.
     ```csharp
     public interface INotificationProvider
     {
         void SendNotification(string message);
     }
     
     public class EmailNotificationProvider : INotificationProvider
     {
         public void SendNotification(string message)
         {
             // Send email notification logic...
         }
     }
     
     public class NotificationService
     {
         private readonly INotificationProvider _notificationProvider;
     
         public NotificationService(INotificationProvider notificationProvider)
         {
             _notificationProvider = notificationProvider;
         }
     
         public void SendNotification(string message)
         {
             _notificationProvider.SendNotification(message);
         }
     }
     ```
   Here, `NotificationService` depends on the abstraction `INotificationProvider`, adhering to DIP. Different implementations of `INotificationProvider`, such as `EmailNotificationProvider`, can be injected without modifying `NotificationService` class.

These examples demonstrate how SOLID principles can be applied in .NET Core C# development to create maintainable, extensible, and robust software systems.
