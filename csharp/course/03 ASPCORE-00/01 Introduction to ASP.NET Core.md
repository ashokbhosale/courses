ASP.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform web application framework developed by Microsoft. It is the successor to the original ASP.NET framework and brings several key features and architectural changes that make it a powerful and modern platform for building web applications. Here are some of the key aspects of ASP.NET Core and how it differs from its predecessors:

1. Cross-Platform:
   - One of the most significant differences is that ASP.NET Core is cross-platform. It can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it more versatile and suitable for a wide range of development and hosting environments. This cross-platform support is achieved by using .NET Core, a modular and cross-platform framework that ASP.NET Core is built upon.

2. High Performance:
   - ASP.NET Core is designed for high performance. It uses a new, lightweight and modular architecture that makes it faster and more resource-efficient compared to traditional ASP.NET. The framework is optimized for web applications with low overhead and high throughput.

3. Modular and Lightweight:
   - ASP.NET Core is modular, allowing you to include only the necessary components for your application, reducing the overall footprint. This modularity also makes it easier to update and maintain your application.

4. Open-Source:
   - ASP.NET Core is open-source, which means the source code is freely available, and the community can contribute to its development. This fosters a more transparent and collaborative development process.

5. Improved Dependency Injection:
   - ASP.NET Core includes a built-in and improved dependency injection (DI) system, which makes it easier to manage and inject dependencies into your application components. This promotes better separation of concerns and testability.

6. Integrated Web API Framework:
   - ASP.NET Core comes with an integrated framework for building Web APIs, making it easier to create RESTful services for your applications. This is in addition to supporting traditional web applications.

7. Unified MVC Framework:
   - ASP.NET Core combines the previously separate ASP.NET MVC and Web API frameworks into a unified MVC framework. This simplifies the development of both web pages and Web APIs within a single application.

8. Cross-Browser Support:
   - ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for modern web standards, making it easier to build applications that work well on various browsers and devices.

9. Improved Tooling:
   - ASP.NET Core comes with enhanced development tooling in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, along with a command-line interface (CLI) for building and managing projects. This makes development and debugging more efficient.

10. .NET Core Ecosystem:
    - ASP.NET Core is part of the broader .NET Core ecosystem, which includes libraries, frameworks, and tools that can be used across different types of applications, such as web, desktop, mobile, and cloud applications.

11. No View State:
    - ASP.NET Core eliminates the concept of "view state" that was present in traditional ASP.NET, resulting in smaller and faster web pages.

12. Better Middleware:
    - ASP.NET Core uses middleware for handling various request and response processing, making it easier to add, remove, or customize components in the request/response pipeline.

Overall, ASP.NET Core is a modern and versatile framework for building web applications and services, and its architectural changes make it more lightweight, scalable, and suitable for a wide range of development scenarios compared to its predecessors. Its cross-platform capabilities, high performance, and open-source nature have made it a popular choice for web development in recent years.
