Absolutely, HTTP status codes provide information about the result of a request made to a server. Here are some common ones:

1. **1xx (Informational):**
   - **100 Continue:** The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body.

2. **2xx (Successful):**
   - **200 OK:** The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.
   - **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
   - **204 No Content:** The server successfully processed the request but there is no content to send in the response.

3. **3xx (Redirection):**
   - **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
   - **304 Not Modified:** The client can use cached data as the resource has not been modified since the last request.

4. **4xx (Client Error):**
   - **400 Bad Request:** The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
   - **401 Unauthorized:** The request requires user authentication.
   - **403 Forbidden:** The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
   - **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found on the server.

5. **5xx (Server Error):**
   - **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message indicating that the server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle.
   - **502 Bad Gateway:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server.
   - **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or is overloaded.

Understanding these status codes is crucial when working with APIs, as they provide information about the success or failure of a request and guide developers in troubleshooting issues.
