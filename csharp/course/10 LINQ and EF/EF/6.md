Certainly! Let's explore advanced querying in Entity Framework Core with .NET Core, including writing complex queries with LINQ, using method syntax for queries, and handling JOIN operations.

1. **Writing Complex Queries with LINQ**:

Entity Framework Core supports LINQ (Language Integrated Query), which allows you to write expressive and powerful queries against your database.

Example of a complex query using LINQ:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

// Instantiate your DbContext
using (var dbContext = new MyDbContext())
{
    var complexQueryResult = dbContext.Authors
        .Where(a => a.Name.StartsWith("J"))
        .OrderByDescending(a => a.Books.Count())
        .Select(a => new
        {
            AuthorName = a.Name,
            BookCount = a.Books.Count()
        })
        .ToList();

    foreach (var result in complexQueryResult)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Author: {result.AuthorName}, Book Count: {result.BookCount}");
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates querying authors whose names start with "J", ordering them by the number of books they have, and projecting the author name and book count.

2. **Using Method Syntax for Queries**:

Entity Framework Core supports both query syntax and method syntax for writing LINQ queries. Method syntax can sometimes be more concise and readable.

Example of using method syntax:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

// Instantiate your DbContext
using (var dbContext = new MyDbContext())
{
    var methodSyntaxQueryResult = dbContext.Authors
        .Where(a => a.Name.StartsWith("J"))
        .OrderByDescending(a => a.Books.Count())
        .Select(a => new
        {
            AuthorName = a.Name,
            BookCount = a.Books.Count()
        })
        .ToList();

    foreach (var result in methodSyntaxQueryResult)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Author: {result.AuthorName}, Book Count: {result.BookCount}");
    }
}
```

3. **Handling JOIN Operations in EF**:

Entity Framework Core simplifies JOIN operations by allowing you to navigate relationships between entities directly in your queries.

Example of a JOIN operation:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

// Instantiate your DbContext
using (var dbContext = new MyDbContext())
{
    var joinQueryResult = dbContext.Authors
        .Join(dbContext.Books,
            author => author.AuthorId,
            book => book.AuthorId,
            (author, book) => new
            {
                AuthorName = author.Name,
                BookTitle = book.Title
            })
        .ToList();

    foreach (var result in joinQueryResult)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Author: {result.AuthorName}, Book Title: {result.BookTitle}");
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates joining the `Authors` and `Books` tables based on the `AuthorId` foreign key relationship and projecting the author name and book title.

These examples illustrate how to write complex queries, use method syntax for queries, and handle JOIN operations in Entity Framework Core with .NET Core.
