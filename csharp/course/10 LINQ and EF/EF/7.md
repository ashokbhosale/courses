Concurrency control is crucial in multi-user environments to ensure data integrity and consistency when multiple users are accessing and modifying the same data simultaneously. Entity Framework Core supports both optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control mechanisms.

1. **Optimistic Concurrency Control**:

Optimistic concurrency control assumes that conflicts between concurrent transactions are rare. It allows multiple users to read and write data concurrently but checks for conflicts at the time of saving changes to the database. If conflicts are detected, EF Core throws a concurrency exception, and the application can handle it accordingly.

Example of using optimistic concurrency control:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

// Instantiate your DbContext
using (var dbContext = new MyDbContext())
{
    var entityToUpdate = dbContext.MyEntities.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == 1);

    if (entityToUpdate != null)
    {
        entityToUpdate.Name = "Updated Entity Name";

        try
        {
            // Save changes to the database
            dbContext.SaveChanges();
            Console.WriteLine("Entity updated successfully.");
        }
        catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException ex)
        {
            // Handle concurrency conflict
            foreach (var entry in ex.Entries)
            {
                if (entry.Entity is MyEntity conflictingEntity)
                {
                    // Reload the entity from the database
                    entry.Reload();
                    // Optionally, merge changes from client with server
                    // conflictingEntity.Name = "Merged updated name";
                }
            }
            Console.WriteLine("Concurrency conflict occurred. Entity reload or merge needed.");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Entity not found.");
    }
}
```

In this example, if another user modifies the entity before saving changes, a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` is thrown, indicating a concurrency conflict. The application can then reload the entity from the database and merge any changes if necessary.

2. **Pessimistic Concurrency Control**:

Pessimistic concurrency control locks database records during read or write operations to prevent other users from accessing them until the lock is released. Entity Framework Core doesn't directly support pessimistic concurrency control, but you can use database transactions and explicit locking mechanisms.

Example of using pessimistic concurrency control:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using System.Transactions;

// Instantiate your DbContext
using (var dbContext = new MyDbContext())
{
    using (var transaction = new TransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.Required,
        new TransactionOptions { IsolationLevel = IsolationLevel.Serializable }))
    {
        var entityToModify = dbContext.MyEntities.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == 1);

        if (entityToModify != null)
        {
            // Lock the entity for exclusive access
            dbContext.Entry(entityToModify).Reload();

            entityToModify.Name = "Updated Entity Name";

            // Save changes within the transaction
            dbContext.SaveChanges();
            Console.WriteLine("Entity updated successfully.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Entity not found.");
        }

        transaction.Complete();
    }
}
```

In this example, a transaction with a serializable isolation level is used to ensure exclusive access to the entity being modified. Other users attempting to access or modify the same entity will be blocked until the transaction completes.

These examples demonstrate how to manage concurrent data updates, handle concurrency conflicts using optimistic concurrency control, and optionally implement pessimistic concurrency control in Entity Framework Core with .NET Core.
