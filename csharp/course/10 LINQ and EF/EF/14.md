Using Entity Framework (EF) in microservices architecture and cloud-based applications requires careful consideration of factors such as scalability, performance, data sharing, and security. Let's explore how to use Entity Framework in these environments with .NET Core, along with examples.

1. **Using Entity Framework in Microservices Architecture**:

In a microservices architecture, each microservice is responsible for its own data persistence. Entity Framework can be used in each microservice to interact with its own database, allowing microservices to independently manage their data.

Example:

```csharp
// MyService.cs (Microservice)
public class MyService
{
    private readonly MyDbContext _dbContext;

    public MyService(MyDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public async Task<List<MyEntity>> GetEntitiesAsync()
    {
        return await _dbContext.MyEntities.ToListAsync();
    }
}
```

In this example, each microservice has its own instance of `MyDbContext`, which is responsible for interacting with its own database.

2. **Entity Framework in Cloud-Based Applications (Azure, AWS)**:

Entity Framework can be used in cloud-based applications deployed on platforms like Azure or AWS. You can leverage cloud-native databases such as Azure SQL Database or Amazon RDS for data persistence.

Example of using Entity Framework with Azure SQL Database:

```csharp
// MyDbContext.cs
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public MyDbContext(DbContextOptions<MyDbContext> options) : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<MyEntity> MyEntities { get; set; }
}

// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("MyDbConnection")));
}
```

In this example, `MyDbContext` is configured to use Azure SQL Database as the data store in the ASP.NET Core application's `Startup.cs` file.

3. **Data Sharing and Security in Distributed Systems**:

a. **Data Sharing**: In a microservices architecture, data sharing between microservices should be minimized to maintain loose coupling. Use asynchronous messaging (e.g., Azure Service Bus, AWS SQS) or APIs to share data between microservices when necessary.

b. **Security**: Implement security measures such as HTTPS, authentication, and authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) to protect data in transit and at rest. Encrypt sensitive data and use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources.

Example of using JWT authentication with Entity Framework:

```csharp
// MyController.cs
[Authorize]
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly MyDbContext _dbContext;

    public MyController(MyDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetEntitiesAsync()
    {
        var entities = await _dbContext.MyEntities.ToListAsync();
        return Ok(entities);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyController` requires authentication using JWT tokens, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data.

By considering these factors and using appropriate patterns and technologies, you can effectively use Entity Framework in microservices architecture and cloud-based applications while addressing data sharing and security concerns in distributed systems.
