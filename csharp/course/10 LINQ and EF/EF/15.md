Entity Framework Core primarily supports relational databases, but it can also be extended to work with NoSQL databases and handle big data scenarios through various approaches. Let's explore how Entity Framework can be used with NoSQL databases, for handling big data, and with distributed data sources.

1. **Entity Framework with NoSQL Databases**:

While Entity Framework Core is designed primarily for relational databases, there are community-driven efforts to provide support for NoSQL databases through third-party providers or custom implementations.

Example of using Entity Framework with a NoSQL database (MongoDB) using a third-party provider:

```csharp
// Install the MongoDB provider for Entity Framework Core
dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver
dotnet add package MongoDB.Entities

// Configure DbContext to use MongoDB
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseMongoDb("mongodb://localhost:27017", "MyDatabase");
    }

    // Define DbSet<T> for MongoDB collections
    public DbSet<MyEntity> MyEntities { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, the `MyDbContext` class is configured to use MongoDB as the data store, and a `DbSet<MyEntity>` is defined to interact with a MongoDB collection.

2. **Handling Big Data with Entity Framework**:

When dealing with big data, it's essential to optimize data access operations and minimize resource consumption. Entity Framework can handle big data scenarios with techniques such as pagination, filtering, and asynchronous query execution.

Example of using Entity Framework for paginated data retrieval:

```csharp
public async Task<List<MyEntity>> GetEntitiesAsync(int pageIndex, int pageSize)
{
    return await _dbContext.MyEntities
        .Skip((pageIndex - 1) * pageSize)
        .Take(pageSize)
        .ToListAsync();
}
```

In this example, `Skip()` and `Take()` methods are used to implement pagination for retrieving data in chunks.

3. **Entity Framework and Distributed Data Sources**:

Entity Framework can be used with distributed data sources by leveraging data federation techniques, sharding, or federated queries.

Example of using Entity Framework with a distributed data source (SQL Server federated database):

```csharp
public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;");
    }

    // Define DbSet<T> for federated tables
    public DbSet<MyEntity> MyEntities { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, `MyDbContext` is configured to connect to a federated SQL Server database, where data is distributed across multiple physical servers.

While Entity Framework Core natively supports relational databases, you can explore community-driven extensions or custom implementations to use Entity Framework with NoSQL databases. Additionally, Entity Framework can handle big data scenarios by optimizing data access operations and leveraging pagination techniques. When dealing with distributed data sources, Entity Framework can be used with federated databases or through custom solutions to handle data federation or sharding.
