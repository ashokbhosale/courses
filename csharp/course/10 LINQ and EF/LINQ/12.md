LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful feature in .NET Core C# that provides a unified way to query and manipulate data from various data sources. Here's how LINQ can be utilized in web development scenarios with examples:

### Using LINQ in ASP.NET Web Applications:

LINQ can be seamlessly integrated into ASP.NET web applications to query data from databases, in-memory collections, or other data sources. It simplifies data access and makes code more readable and maintainable.

Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web.Mvc;
using MyWebApp.Models;

public class ProductController : Controller
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;

    public ProductController()
    {
        _dbContext = new ApplicationDbContext();
    }

    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        // Query products using LINQ
        var products = _dbContext.Products.Where(p => p.Category == "Electronics").ToList();
        return View(products);
    }
}
```

In this ASP.NET MVC example, LINQ is used to query products from a database based on a specific category ("Electronics") and pass the results to a view for rendering.

### LINQ for RESTful Web Services:

LINQ can also be used in RESTful web services to query and filter data before returning it to clients. It enables developers to perform data manipulation operations easily and efficiently.

Example:

```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;

    public ProductsController(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetProducts()
    {
        // Query products using LINQ
        var products = _dbContext.Products.Where(p => p.Category == "Electronics").ToList();
        return Ok(products);
    }
}
```

In this ASP.NET Core Web API example, LINQ is used to query products from a database based on a specific category ("Electronics") and return the results as JSON to clients.

### LINQ in API Development:

LINQ can simplify API development by providing a fluent and expressive way to query and manipulate data from various sources. It enables developers to write concise and readable code when implementing API endpoints.

Example:

```csharp
public class ProductService
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;

    public ProductService(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Product> GetProductsByCategory(string category)
    {
        // Query products using LINQ
        return _dbContext.Products.Where(p => p.Category == category).ToList();
    }
}
```

In this example, a service class encapsulates the logic for querying products by category using LINQ. This service can be injected into API controllers to handle product-related operations.

By leveraging LINQ in web development, developers can write cleaner, more concise code while efficiently querying and manipulating data.
