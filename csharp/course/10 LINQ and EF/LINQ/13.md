LINQ (Language Integrated Query) can be a valuable tool for data analytics and reporting tasks in .NET Core C# applications. It provides a unified and expressive syntax for querying and processing data from various sources. Here's how LINQ can be utilized in data analytics and reporting scenarios along with examples:

### Utilizing LINQ for Data Analytics and Reporting:

LINQ can be used to perform various data analytics tasks such as filtering, aggregation, grouping, and transformation on datasets. It enables developers to write concise and expressive queries for analyzing data.

Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Sample data
        var salesData = new List<Sale>
        {
            new Sale { Product = "Product A", Amount = 100 },
            new Sale { Product = "Product B", Amount = 150 },
            new Sale { Product = "Product A", Amount = 200 },
            new Sale { Product = "Product C", Amount = 120 },
            new Sale { Product = "Product B", Amount = 180 }
        };

        // Calculate total sales amount per product using LINQ
        var salesByProduct = salesData.GroupBy(s => s.Product)
                                       .Select(g => new
                                       {
                                           Product = g.Key,
                                           TotalSales = g.Sum(s => s.Amount)
                                       });

        // Display results
        foreach (var sale in salesByProduct)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Product: {sale.Product}, Total Sales: {sale.TotalSales}");
        }
    }
}

class Sale
{
    public string Product { get; set; }
    public decimal Amount { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, LINQ is used to group sales data by product and calculate the total sales amount for each product.

### Integrating LINQ with Reporting Tools:

LINQ can be integrated with reporting tools such as Microsoft's SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), Telerik Reporting, or DevExpress Reports. Developers can use LINQ queries to retrieve data from databases or other sources and pass the results to reporting components for generating reports.

Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms;

public partial class ReportViewerPage : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (!IsPostBack)
        {
            var dbContext = new ApplicationDbContext();

            // Retrieve data using LINQ query
            var salesData = dbContext.Sales.Where(s => s.Date >= DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-6)).ToList();

            // Bind data to report viewer
            ReportViewer1.LocalReport.DataSources.Add(new ReportDataSource("SalesDataSet", salesData));
            ReportViewer1.LocalReport.ReportPath = Server.MapPath("~/Reports/SalesReport.rdlc");
            ReportViewer1.LocalReport.Refresh();
        }
    }
}
```

In this ASP.NET example, LINQ is used to retrieve sales data from a database and bind it to a report viewer control for displaying a sales report.

### Complex Data Processing and Analysis:

LINQ can handle complex data processing and analysis tasks such as joining multiple datasets, performing advanced filtering and aggregation operations, and implementing custom calculations.

Example:

```csharp
// Joining multiple datasets and performing calculations
var combinedData = from s in salesData
                   join p in productData on s.ProductId equals p.Id
                   where s.Date >= startDate && s.Date <= endDate
                   group new { s, p } by p.Category into g
                   select new
                   {
                       Category = g.Key,
                       TotalSales = g.Sum(x => x.s.Amount),
                       AveragePrice = g.Average(x => x.p.Price)
                   };
```

In this example, LINQ is used to join sales data with product data, group by product category, and calculate total sales and average price for each category.

By leveraging LINQ in data analytics and reporting, developers can efficiently process and analyze data, generate reports, and derive insights from datasets in .NET Core C# applications.
