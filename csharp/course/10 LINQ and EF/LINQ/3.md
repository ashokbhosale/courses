LINQ to XML provides a convenient and expressive way to work with XML data in .NET Core C#. It allows developers to query, manipulate, and create XML documents using LINQ query syntax or method syntax. Here's an overview of working with XML data using LINQ to XML with examples:

### Working with XML Data:

LINQ to XML allows you to work with XML data in a natural and intuitive way, similar to querying in-memory collections. You can load XML documents, query elements and attributes, modify existing XML structures, and create new XML documents.

### Querying and Modifying XML Documents:

LINQ to XML provides various query operators and methods for querying and modifying XML documents. You can use standard LINQ query operators like Where, Select, OrderBy, and GroupBy to filter, project, and order XML elements. Additionally, methods like Add, Remove, and Replace allow you to modify the structure of XML documents.

### XML Namespaces and Attributes:

LINQ to XML supports XML namespaces and attributes, allowing you to work with XML documents that contain namespaces and attributes. You can query elements and attributes within specific namespaces, and manipulate XML attributes using LINQ to XML methods.

### Example:

Here's an example demonstrating how to work with XML data using LINQ to XML:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Xml.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Load XML document
        XDocument doc = XDocument.Load("books.xml");

        // Query XML elements
        var query = from book in doc.Descendants("book")
                    where (int)book.Element("price") > 10
                    orderby (string)book.Element("title")
                    select new
                    {
                        Title = (string)book.Element("title"),
                        Author = (string)book.Element("author"),
                        Price = (decimal)book.Element("price")
                    };

        // Print query results
        foreach (var book in query)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Title: {book.Title}, Author: {book.Author}, Price: {book.Price}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Conclusion:

LINQ to XML provides a powerful and efficient way to work with XML data in .NET Core C#. By leveraging LINQ query syntax or method syntax, developers can easily query, modify, and create XML documents, making XML processing tasks more intuitive and straightforward. Additionally, support for XML namespaces and attributes allows for working with complex XML structures effectively.
