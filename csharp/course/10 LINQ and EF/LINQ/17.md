PLINQ (Parallel LINQ) is an extension of LINQ that enables parallel execution of LINQ queries, leveraging multiple CPU cores to improve performance for data-intensive operations. Here's an example of how to use PLINQ in .NET Core C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Sample data
        var numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 1000000);

        // PLINQ query to filter even numbers and calculate their squares in parallel
        var result = numbers.AsParallel()
                            .Where(num => num % 2 == 0)
                            .Select(num => num * num)
                            .ToList();

        // Output the first 10 results
        foreach (var item in result.Take(10))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `AsParallel()` is used to convert the enumerable sequence into a parallel query. Then, `Where()` is used to filter even numbers in parallel, followed by `Select()` to calculate their squares. Finally, `ToList()` is called to materialize the results into a list.

PLINQ can significantly improve the performance of LINQ queries, especially when dealing with large datasets or computationally intensive operations. However, it's essential to consider factors such as thread safety, resource utilization, and potential overhead when using PLINQ in your applications.
