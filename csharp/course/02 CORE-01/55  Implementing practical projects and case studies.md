Implementing practical projects and case studies using .NET Core C# can be a great way to learn and showcase your skills. Let's outline a couple of project ideas along with examples:

### 1. Task Management Application:

#### Description:
Create a web-based task management application where users can create, update, and delete tasks. Users can also assign tasks to other users, set due dates, and mark tasks as completed.

#### Example:

You can use ASP.NET Core MVC for the backend, Entity Framework Core for data access, and a front-end framework like Angular or React for the user interface. Here's a simplified example of creating a task entity and CRUD operations:

```csharp
public class Task
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public DateTime DueDate { get; set; }
    public bool IsCompleted { get; set; }
    // Other properties like Assignee, Priority, etc.
}

public class TasksController : Controller
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public TasksController(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    // GET: Tasks
    public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
    {
        return View(await _context.Tasks.ToListAsync());
    }

    // GET: Tasks/Create
    public IActionResult Create()
    {
        return View();
    }

    // POST: Tasks/Create
    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Create([Bind("Id,Title,Description,DueDate,IsCompleted")] Task task)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            _context.Add(task);
            await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
            return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
        }
        return View(task);
    }

    // Other CRUD actions (Update, Delete)
}
```

### 2. E-commerce Website:

#### Description:
Develop a full-fledged e-commerce website where users can browse products, add items to their cart, proceed to checkout, and make purchases securely. Implement features like user authentication, product search, product categories, and order management.

#### Example:

For the backend, you can use ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core for data access and Identity Framework for user authentication. For the front end, you can use Razor Pages or a front-end framework like Blazor or Angular. Here's a simplified example of listing products and adding items to the cart:

```csharp
public class ProductsController : Controller
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

    public ProductsController(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    // GET: Products
    public async Task<IActionResult> Index()
    {
        return View(await _context.Products.ToListAsync());
    }

    // GET: Products/Details/5
    public async Task<IActionResult> Details(int? id)
    {
        if (id == null)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        var product = await _context.Products
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync(m => m.Id == id);
        if (product == null)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }

        return View(product);
    }

    // Other actions (AddToCart, Checkout, etc.)
}
```

### Conclusion:

Implementing practical projects and case studies using .NET Core C# can be an excellent way to apply your skills, learn new concepts, and build a portfolio of work. Choose projects that interest you and align with your career goals, and don't hesitate to experiment with different technologies and frameworks to broaden your knowledge. As you work on these projects, focus on writing clean, maintainable code, and leverage best practices and design patterns to build robust and scalable applications.
