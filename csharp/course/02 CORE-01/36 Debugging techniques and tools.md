Debugging is a crucial aspect of software development, and .NET Core C# provides various techniques and tools to help you debug your applications effectively. Here are some debugging techniques and tools along with examples:

### Debugging Techniques

1. **Logging**:
   - Use logging to output information, warnings, errors, and other messages during the execution of your application.
   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

   public class MyClass
   {
       private readonly ILogger<MyClass> _logger;

       public MyClass(ILogger<MyClass> logger)
       {
           _logger = logger;
       }

       public void DoSomething()
       {
           _logger.LogInformation("Doing something...");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Console.WriteLine()**:
   - Use `Console.WriteLine()` statements to print debug messages to the console output.
   ```csharp
   public class MyClass
   {
       public void DoSomething()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Doing something...");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **DebuggerStepThroughAttribute**:
   - Use the `DebuggerStepThrough` attribute to skip stepping into specific methods during debugging.
   ```csharp
   [DebuggerStepThrough]
   public void MethodToSkip()
   {
       // Code to skip during debugging
   }
   ```

4. **Conditional Breakpoints**:
   - Set breakpoints with conditions to break execution only when specific conditions are met.

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - Use try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and inspect their details during debugging.
   ```csharp
   try
   {
       // Code that may throw an exception
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
   }
   ```

### Debugging Tools

1. **Visual Studio Debugger**:
   - Use Visual Studio's built-in debugger to set breakpoints, inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the execution flow.

2. **Logging Frameworks**:
   - Use logging frameworks like Serilog or Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to log messages at different log levels and configure logging output to various destinations.

3. **Console Output**:
   - Print debug messages and variable values to the console output using `Console.WriteLine()` statements.

4. **.NET Core CLI Debugging Tools**:
   - Use .NET Core CLI debugging commands like `dotnet watch run`, `dotnet run`, `dotnet test`, and `dotnet publish` to build, run, test, and debug .NET Core applications from the command line.

5. **Remote Debugging**:
   - Use remote debugging to debug applications running on remote machines or devices.

By using these debugging techniques and tools, you can diagnose and fix issues in your .NET Core C# applications efficiently, improving the overall quality and reliability of your software.
