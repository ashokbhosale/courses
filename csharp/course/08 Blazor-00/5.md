Navigation and routing are essential for building multi-page applications in Blazor. You can implement navigation using the `NavigationManager` and set up routing to define which components or pages should be displayed for specific URLs. Here's how you can do it in .NET Core C#:

### Implementing Navigation with NavigationManager:

The `NavigationManager` class in Blazor provides functionality for navigating between pages within the application.

#### Example Navigation using NavigationManager:

```html
@page "/"
@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

<h1>Welcome to My Blazor App</h1>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="NavigateToCounter">Go to Counter</button>

@code {
    private void NavigateToCounter()
    {
        NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/counter");
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `NavigationManager` is injected into the component.
- Clicking the button triggers the `NavigateToCounter` method, which navigates to the Counter page using the `NavigateTo` method of the `NavigationManager`.

### Setting Up Routing:

Routing in Blazor allows you to define which components or pages should be displayed for specific URLs.

#### Example Routing (`App.razor`):

```html
<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly">
    <Found Context="routeData">
        <RouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
    </Found>
    <NotFound>
        <LayoutView Layout="@typeof(MainLayout)">
            <p>Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
        </LayoutView>
    </NotFound>
</Router>
```

In this example:
- The `<Router>` component is used to define routing for the application.
- The `<Found>` component handles routes that match a defined route pattern.
- The `<NotFound>` component displays a message for routes that do not match any defined route pattern.

#### Defining Routes:

You can define routes using the `@page` directive in Blazor components. For example:

```html
@page "/counter"
```

This directive specifies that the component should be displayed when the URL matches the "/counter" path.

### Conclusion:

By implementing navigation with the `NavigationManager` and setting up routing in your Blazor application, you can create a seamless navigation experience for users and define the structure of your multi-page application. These examples demonstrate how to implement navigation and routing in .NET Core C# Blazor applications effectively.
