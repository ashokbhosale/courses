Server-side Blazor and client-side Blazor offer distinct approaches for building web applications. Let's explore server-side Blazor, understand its differences from client-side Blazor, and create a server-side Blazor application with an example in .NET Core C#:

### Understanding Server-Side Blazor:

Server-side Blazor runs on the server and handles UI interactions over a SignalR connection with the client browser. The UI components and logic are executed on the server, and only UI updates are sent to the client. This architecture offers benefits such as simplified client requirements, improved security, and scalability.

### Differences from Client-Side Blazor:

1. **Execution Location**: Server-side Blazor executes code on the server, while client-side Blazor runs code in the browser.
2. **UI Updates**: In server-side Blazor, UI updates are sent from the server to the client over a SignalR connection, while client-side Blazor updates the UI directly in the browser.
3. **Performance**: Server-side Blazor may have slightly higher latency due to round-trips to the server for UI updates, while client-side Blazor may have faster initial load times but requires more client resources for execution.

### Creating a Server-Side Blazor Application:

To create a server-side Blazor application, you can use the `dotnet` CLI or Visual Studio. Here's how to create one using the CLI:

1. **Create a New Server-Side Blazor Project:**
   ```bash
   dotnet new blazorserver -n MyServerSideApp
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd MyServerSideApp
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

### Example Server-Side Blazor Component (`Counter.razor`):

```html
@page "/counter"

<h1>Counter</h1>

<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Counter` component is the same as in client-side Blazor. However, its execution occurs on the server, and UI updates are sent to the client over the SignalR connection.

### Conclusion:

Server-side Blazor provides an alternative approach to building web applications where UI logic is executed on the server. By understanding its differences from client-side Blazor and creating server-side Blazor applications, you can leverage its benefits such as simplified client requirements and improved scalability in your .NET Core C# projects.
