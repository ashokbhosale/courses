**Introduction to .NET Core:**

.NET Core is a free, open-source, cross-platform framework for building modern, high-performance applications. It was developed by Microsoft and first released in 2016. .NET Core is designed to be modular, lightweight, and highly scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of application types, from web and mobile apps to microservices and cloud-native applications.

**Key Features and Advantages:**
1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** .NET Core runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing developers to write code once and run it on multiple platforms.
2. **Modularity:** .NET Core is modular, allowing developers to include only the necessary components in their applications, resulting in smaller, more efficient deployments.
3. **Performance:** .NET Core is optimized for performance, with features like just-in-time (JIT) compilation, asynchronous programming, and lightweight threading.
4. **Open-Source:** .NET Core is open-source, with its development being guided by the community on GitHub. This allows developers to contribute improvements, report bugs, and provide feedback.
5. **Cloud-Native:** .NET Core is well-suited for cloud-native development, with built-in support for containerization, microservices architecture, and serverless computing.

**Example: Hello World in .NET Core:**
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
In this example, we have a simple C# console application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This application can be built and run on any platform supported by .NET Core, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**History:**
- .NET Core was introduced as an evolution of the .NET Framework, aiming to address the limitations of the traditional .NET Framework, such as platform dependency and performance.
- The first version of .NET Core, known as .NET Core 1.0, was released in June 2016.
- Subsequent versions, such as .NET Core 2.0, .NET Core 3.0, and .NET Core 5.0 (which later became .NET 5.0), introduced new features, performance improvements, and increased compatibility with existing .NET Framework libraries.
- With the release of .NET 5.0, Microsoft unified the .NET platform, merging .NET Core, .NET Framework, and Xamarin into a single, cohesive platform called .NET.

**Role in Modern Application Development:**
.NET Core plays a crucial role in modern application development by providing developers with a flexible, high-performance framework for building a wide range of applications, including web applications, APIs, mobile apps, desktop applications, and cloud-native microservices. Its cross-platform compatibility, modularity, and performance make it a popular choice for building modern, scalable, and resilient applications in today's fast-paced development environment.
