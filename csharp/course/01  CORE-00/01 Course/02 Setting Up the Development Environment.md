**Setting Up the Development Environment:**

To start developing .NET Core applications, you'll need to install the .NET Core SDK and choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

**Step 1: Install .NET Core SDK:**
- Visit the official .NET Core download page: [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Download and install the .NET Core SDK for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

**Step 2: Choose an IDE:**
You can choose between Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, both of which provide excellent support for .NET Core development.

- **Visual Studio (Windows/macOS):**
  - Download and install Visual Studio Community, Professional, or Enterprise edition from [visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
  - Ensure that you select the ".NET Core cross-platform development" workload during installation.

- **Visual Studio Code (Cross-platform):**
  - Download and install Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  - Install the C# extension for Visual Studio Code by Microsoft from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

**Example: Creating a New .NET Core Console Application:**

After setting up your development environment, you can create a new .NET Core console application using either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

**Using Visual Studio:**
1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Go to "File" > "New" > "Project...".
3. Select "Console App (.NET Core)" under the "C#" category.
4. Choose a name and location for your project, then click "Create".
5. Visual Studio will generate a basic .NET Core console application template for you to start coding.

**Using Visual Studio Code:**
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open a new terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
4. Run the following command to create a new .NET Core console application:
   ```
   dotnet new console -n MyConsoleApp
   ```
   Replace "MyConsoleApp" with the name of your project.
5. Open the newly created project folder in Visual Studio Code:
   ```
   code .
   ```
6. Visual Studio Code will open the project folder with the necessary files and folders for your .NET Core console application.

Now you're ready to start coding and building .NET Core applications using your preferred IDE!
