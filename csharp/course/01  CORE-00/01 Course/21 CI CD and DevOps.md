Setting up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines is crucial for automating the process of building, testing, and deploying your .NET Core applications. Azure DevOps and Jenkins are popular tools for CI/CD. Let's see how to set up CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps with an example.

### Example: Setting up CI/CD with Azure DevOps for .NET Core Applications

1. Create an Azure DevOps organization and project.

2. Navigate to Pipelines -> Builds in Azure DevOps and create a new build pipeline.

3. Select your source code repository (e.g., Azure Repos Git, GitHub) and configure your pipeline settings.

4. Configure your build pipeline YAML file (azure-pipelines.yml) to define the steps for building and testing your .NET Core application:

```yaml
trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'build'
    projects: '**/*.csproj'

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'test'
    projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration)'
```

5. Save and run your build pipeline to ensure it builds and tests your application successfully.

6. Navigate to Pipelines -> Releases in Azure DevOps and create a new release pipeline.

7. Select your artifact (the build output) and configure your release pipeline settings.

8. Add a stage to deploy your application to Azure App Service or any other hosting environment:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Deploy
  displayName: 'Deploy to Azure App Service'
  pool:
    vmImage: 'windows-latest'
  
  steps:
  - task: AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4
    inputs:
      ConnectionType: 'AzureRM'
      azureSubscription: '<AzureServiceConnection>'
      appType: 'webApp'
      WebAppName: '<YourAppServiceName>'
      packageForLinux: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/**/*.zip'
      enableCustomDeployment: true
```

9. Save and create a release in your release pipeline.

10. Trigger your release pipeline manually or set up triggers to automatically deploy when a new build is available.

With this setup, Azure DevOps will automatically build, test, and deploy your .NET Core application whenever changes are pushed to the repository, ensuring continuous integration and continuous deployment of your application.
