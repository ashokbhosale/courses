**Dependency Injection and Middleware in .NET Core:**

**Understanding the Concept of Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET Core:**

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to manage dependencies between objects in an application. In .NET Core, DI is a built-in feature that allows you to decouple components by injecting dependencies into classes rather than having the classes create their dependencies directly. This promotes loose coupling, which makes the application easier to maintain, test, and extend.

**Implementing DI using Built-in Container:**

In .NET Core, the built-in dependency injection container is used to register dependencies and resolve them at runtime. You can register services in the container during application startup and specify their lifetimes (e.g., singleton, scoped, transient). Here's an example of registering a service in the container and injecting it into a controller:

```csharp
// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
    services.AddTransient<IOtherService, OtherService>();
}

// MyController.cs
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;
    private readonly IOtherService _otherService;

    public MyController(IMyService myService, IOtherService otherService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
        _otherService = otherService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var result = _myService.DoSomething();
        return View(result);
    }
}
```

**Creating Custom Middleware Components for Cross-Cutting Concerns:**

Middleware components in ASP.NET Core are software components that can handle HTTP requests and responses. They are executed in the order they are registered in the application's request processing pipeline. Middleware is often used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, authorization, error handling, and request/response manipulation. Here's an example of creating custom middleware for logging:

```csharp
// LoggingMiddleware.cs
public class LoggingMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
    private readonly ILogger<LoggingMiddleware> _logger;

    public LoggingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<LoggingMiddleware> logger)
    {
        _next = next;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation($"Request: {context.Request.Path}");

        await _next(context);

        _logger.LogInformation($"Response: {context.Response.StatusCode}");
    }
}

// Startup.cs
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware>();
    // Other middleware registrations...
}
```

In this example, the `LoggingMiddleware` logs information about incoming requests and outgoing responses. It's injected with the `ILogger<T>` interface for logging.

These examples demonstrate how to use dependency injection and middleware in .NET Core applications. Dependency injection helps manage dependencies between components, while middleware provides a flexible way to handle cross-cutting concerns in the request processing pipeline.
