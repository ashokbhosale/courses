In Azure, networking plays a crucial role in connecting various resources, ensuring secure communication, and controlling traffic flow within your cloud environment. Here's an overview of setting up virtual networks, subnets, and configuring security groups in Azure:

1. **Virtual Networks (VNets)**:
   - Virtual Networks (VNets) in Azure are isolated network environments that you can set up and control. They provide segmentation and isolation for your Azure resources.
   - To set up a virtual network, you navigate to the Azure Portal and create a new VNet. You define the address space (CIDR block) for the VNet, which determines the range of IP addresses it can use.
   - You can also configure DNS settings, subnets, and various other properties during VNet creation.

2. **Subnets**:
   - Subnets are subdivisions of a VNet that allow you to segment your network further. They can be used to group resources together logically and apply different network policies.
   - When creating a VNet, you can define multiple subnets within it. Each subnet is associated with a specific CIDR block, which represents a range of IP addresses.
   - Subnets can be used to organize resources based on their function, such as web servers, application servers, and databases.

3. **Security Groups (Network Security Groups)**:
   - Network Security Groups (NSGs) act as a basic firewall for controlling traffic to and from Azure resources within a VNet or between VNets.
   - You can define inbound and outbound security rules in an NSG to allow or deny traffic based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
   - NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces attached to Azure VMs.
   - Security rules in NSGs are evaluated in priority order, and the first matching rule determines whether traffic is allowed or denied.

To set up virtual networks, subnets, and configure security groups in Azure:

1. **Create a Virtual Network**:
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal.
   - Go to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Virtual network."
   - Fill in the required details such as name, address space, and subnet details.

2. **Create Subnets**:
   - While creating the VNet, specify the subnet details.
   - You can also add additional subnets later by navigating to the VNet resource and selecting "Subnets."

3. **Configure Security Groups**:
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal.
   - Go to "Create a resource" > "Networking" > "Network security group."
   - Define the necessary inbound and outbound security rules based on your requirements.

Once set up, you can attach Azure resources such as virtual machines, Azure App Services, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to the appropriate subnets and apply NSGs to control traffic flow.
