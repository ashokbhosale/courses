### Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) provide scalable computing resources in the cloud. This guide will help you learn how to create, configure, and manage VMs in the Azure environment.

#### Creating an Azure Virtual Machine

1. **Sign In to Azure Portal:**
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Microsoft account.

2. **Navigate to Virtual Machines:**
   - In the left-hand menu, select "Virtual Machines."
   - Click on the "+ Add" button to create a new VM.

3. **Configure Basic Settings:**
   - **Subscription:** Select the appropriate subscription.
   - **Resource Group:** Choose an existing resource group or create a new one.
   - **Virtual Machine Name:** Enter a unique name for your VM.
   - **Region:** Select the region where you want to deploy the VM.
   - **Availability Options:** Choose from options like Availability Zone, Availability Set, or No infrastructure redundancy required.
   - **Image:** Select the operating system image (e.g., Windows Server, Ubuntu).
   - **Size:** Choose the VM size based on your performance and pricing needs.

4. **Configure Administrator Account:**
   - **Authentication Type:** Choose between Password or SSH public key.
   - **Username:** Enter a username for the admin account.
   - **Password/SSH Key:** Enter a password or upload an SSH key for authentication.

5. **Configure Disks:**
   - **OS Disk Type:** Choose the disk type (e.g., Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD).
   - **Data Disks:** Optionally, add additional data disks for storage.

6. **Networking:**
   - **Virtual Network:** Select an existing virtual network or create a new one.
   - **Subnet:** Choose a subnet within the selected virtual network.
   - **Public IP:** Assign a public IP address for accessing the VM.
   - **Network Security Group (NSG):** Configure inbound and outbound rules to control traffic to the VM.

7. **Management:**
   - Configure monitoring, backup, and diagnostics settings as needed.

8. **Review and Create:**
   - Review all the configurations.
   - Click on the "Create" button to deploy the VM.

#### Managing Azure Virtual Machines

Once your VM is deployed, you can manage it through the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell.

1. **Accessing the VM:**
   - **Windows VM:** Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect.
     - In the Azure Portal, navigate to the VM and select "Connect."
     - Download the RDP file and open it to connect.
   - **Linux VM:** Use SSH to connect.
     - Open a terminal and use the SSH command:
       ```sh
       ssh <username>@<public-ip-address>
       ```

2. **Starting, Stopping, and Restarting:**
   - In the Azure Portal, go to the VM's overview page.
   - Use the "Start," "Stop," and "Restart" buttons to control the VM's state.

3. **Scaling the VM:**
   - You can resize the VM to adjust its performance and pricing.
   - In the VM's overview page, click on "Size" and select a new size from the list of available options.

4. **Monitoring and Diagnostics:**
   - Azure provides built-in monitoring and diagnostics tools to track VM performance and health.
   - Navigate to "Metrics" or "Diagnostics settings" to configure and view metrics like CPU usage, disk I/O, and network traffic.

5. **Applying Updates and Patches:**
   - Ensure your VM's operating system and applications are up-to-date with the latest patches and updates.
   - Use Azure Update Management or manually manage updates through the VM's OS.

6. **Configuring Backup and Recovery:**
   - Use Azure Backup to configure automated backups for your VM.
   - Navigate to "Backup" in the VM's management settings, set up a Recovery Services vault, and configure backup policies.

7. **Managing Disks:**
   - Add or remove data disks as needed.
   - In the VM's settings, go to "Disks" and attach new data disks or manage existing ones.

8. **Configuring Networking:**
   - Manage NSG rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
   - Assign static or dynamic public IP addresses.

#### Conclusion

Creating and managing Azure Virtual Machines involves configuring the VMâ€™s settings, accessing it securely, and utilizing Azure's management tools for monitoring, scaling, and maintaining the VM. By understanding these steps, you can effectively deploy and manage VMs to meet your computing needs in the Azure cloud environment.
