Azure Storage is a cloud storage solution offered by Microsoft Azure, providing scalable, secure, and highly available storage services for various types of data. Here's an overview of the key Azure storage services:

1. **Blob Storage**: Blob (Binary Large Object) storage is designed to store large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, images, videos, and logs. It offers three types of blobs:
   - **Block Blobs**: Ideal for streaming and storing documents, images, and videos.
   - **Page Blobs**: Suited for random read/write operations and used by Azure Virtual Machines.
   - **Append Blobs**: Optimized for append operations, making them ideal for logging scenarios.

2. **Table Storage**: Table storage is a NoSQL key-value store suitable for semi-structured data. It's a cost-effective solution for storing large amounts of structured data like logs, device information, and metadata. Unlike traditional relational databases, Table Storage doesn't require a fixed schema, offering more flexibility.

3. **Azure File Storage**: Azure File Storage provides fully managed file shares in the cloud, accessible via the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. It enables organizations to create file shares that can be accessed from anywhere using a URL. Azure File Storage is suitable for scenarios like file sharing across multiple VMs, application data sharing, and disaster recovery.

Key features of Azure Storage services include:

- **Scalability**: Azure Storage scales dynamically to accommodate growing data requirements without the need for manual intervention.
- **Durability and Availability**: Azure Storage replicates data to ensure high durability and availability. It typically provides redundancy within a datacenter and across multiple datacenters within a region.
- **Security**: Azure Storage offers robust security features, including encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control (RBAC), and Azure Active Directory integration.
- **Global Reach**: Azure Storage services are available in multiple regions worldwide, allowing users to deploy applications closer to their customers for better performance.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Azure Storage offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing users to pay only for the storage and resources they consume, without any upfront costs.

Developers can interact with Azure Storage services using various programming languages and SDKs, including .NET, Java, Python, and Node.js. Additionally, Azure provides management tools like Azure Portal, Azure CLI, and Azure PowerShell for managing and monitoring storage resources.
