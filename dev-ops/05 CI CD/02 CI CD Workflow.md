A typical CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipeline consists of multiple stages, each designed to automate and optimize a specific aspect of the software development and deployment process. These stages help ensure the quality, reliability, and efficiency of software delivery. While specific pipelines can vary based on project requirements and technologies, the following stages are common in a standard CI/CD pipeline:

**1. Source Code Management:**
   - The pipeline starts with source code management (SCM), where developers commit code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
   - The SCM triggers the CI/CD pipeline, initiating the build process when changes are detected.

**2. Build:**
   - The build stage involves compiling the source code into executable binaries or artifacts. This is where the code is transformed from source code files into a deployable format.
   - The build may include tasks like compiling code, packaging applications, and generating libraries or executables.
   - Build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, or make, are often used in this stage to automate the build process.

**3. Automated Testing:**
   - Automated testing is a critical stage that verifies the quality and functionality of the code.
   - This stage includes various types of tests:
     - **Unit Tests:** Verify individual components of the code to ensure they function correctly in isolation.
     - **Integration Tests:** Validate the interaction between components or services.
     - **Functional Tests:** Evaluate the application's behavior from an end-user perspective.
     - **Performance Tests:** Assess the application's performance under load.
     - **Security Tests:** Identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.

**4. Static Code Analysis:**
   - Static code analysis tools check the code for potential issues, such as coding standards violations, code smells, and potential security vulnerabilities.
   - This helps maintain code quality and adherence to coding guidelines.

**5. Artifact Generation:**
   - In this stage, the pipeline generates deployable artifacts (e.g., JAR, WAR files, Docker images) that are ready for deployment.
   - These artifacts are typically stored in a repository for later use in the deployment stage.

**6. Deployment to Staging Environment:**
   - After the artifacts are generated and tests pass successfully, the pipeline deploys the application to a staging environment. This is a replica of the production environment.
   - Staging is used for further testing, including user acceptance testing (UAT) and performance testing.
   - Deployment to staging may include provisioning infrastructure, configuring databases, and setting up the environment.

**7. Automated Testing (Staging):**
   - Testing continues in the staging environment to ensure that the application works correctly in a production-like setting.
   - Additional rounds of testing can include regression testing, load testing, and other quality assurance checks.

**8. Approval and Manual Testing (Optional):**
   - Some organizations include a manual testing and approval step in the pipeline, where designated stakeholders review and validate the application in the staging environment.
   - This step is often followed by a go/no-go decision for promotion to the production environment.

**9. Deployment to Production:**
   - If the application passes all tests and receives necessary approvals, the pipeline deploys the new version to the production environment.
   - Deployment to production should be carefully orchestrated to minimize downtime and potential issues.

**10. Post-Deployment Testing and Monitoring:**
    - After deployment to production, the pipeline may include additional automated tests and monitoring to ensure that the application performs well in the live environment.
    - Monitoring tools are used to gather data on system performance and user behavior.

**11. Rollback (Optional):**
    - In the event of issues or failures in the production environment, the pipeline should include a rollback process to quickly revert to the previous working version of the application.

**12. Reporting and Notifications:**
    - Throughout the pipeline, reporting and notification mechanisms provide real-time feedback to development and operations teams.
    - These notifications can include information on build success, test results, and deployment status.

A well-structured CI/CD pipeline streamlines the software development and delivery process, allowing teams to deliver new features and fixes rapidly while maintaining a high level of software quality and reliability. Customization of the pipeline stages is common to suit the specific needs of each project or organization.
