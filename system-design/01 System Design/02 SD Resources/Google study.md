(III) Last Tips Before Interview:  
- Pick any of your project and try to come up with its High Level Design.  
- Analyse the scenarios where the system can probably fail and try to improve it.  
- In Interviews, Listen and list down all the requirement of System Design Questions carefully,  
- Try to clarify the question, requirements as much as possible,  
- Don't directly jump into measurement,approximation, you should be knowing the motive behind this  
- Try to clarify your approach step by step to the interviewer using diagrams, and carefully answer the cross questions,  
- You should be aware of every component/DB you will be using in your system, and you should be prepare for the cross questions like why you are using this, or what is the benefit of using this over other.  
- Be Patient, Capture Hints from interviewer,  
- And most importantly enjoy the whole interview,  
  
All the best!
