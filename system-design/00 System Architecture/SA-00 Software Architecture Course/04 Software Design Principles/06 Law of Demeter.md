The Law of Demeter, often referred to as the "Principle of Least Knowledge," is a design guideline in object-oriented programming that promotes loose coupling and information hiding. It was introduced by Ian Holland and Joe W. Warren in 1987 and named after the Demeter Project at Northeastern University.

The Law of Demeter can be summarized as follows:

"Each unit (e.g., class or method) should have limited knowledge about other units. It should only communicate with its immediate neighbors and not reach out to distant units."

In other words, an object should interact with its immediate collaborators and not have direct knowledge of the internal structure or dependencies of other objects. This principle aims to reduce the coupling between classes or components, making the system more maintainable and less prone to cascading changes when one component is modified.

**Key Principles of the Law of Demeter:**

1. **Only talk to your immediate friends:** An object should only invoke methods or access properties of objects that it directly holds a reference to. It shouldn't navigate through long chains of objects to access the properties or methods of distant objects.
    
2. **Don't get too much information:** An object should avoid requesting too much information about another object. It should only request the specific information it needs, rather than asking for an entire object's state.
    
3. **Avoid methods with too many parameters:** A method should not have a large number of parameters, as this can indicate that it's trying to do too much and might be violating the principle.
    

**Example:**

Consider an example of an object-oriented design for a banking system:

javaCopy code
public class Bank {
    private List<Account> accounts;

    public Bank() {
        accounts = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addAccount(Account account) {
        accounts.add(account);
    }

    public void transferFunds(Account source, Account target, double amount) {
        // The Bank class directly holds references to Account objects.
        if (accounts.contains(source) && accounts.contains(target)) {
            source.withdraw(amount);
            target.deposit(amount);
        }
    }
}

public class Account {
    private double balance;

    public Account(double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }
}

In this example, the `Bank` class adheres to the Law of Demeter. It directly holds references to `Account` objects and communicates only with its immediate neighbors. It doesn't navigate through a complex hierarchy of objects to perform fund transfers.

By following the Law of Demeter, you create more modular and maintainable code. Changes to the internal structure of objects have a limited impact, and dependencies between objects are reduced, making the codebase more robust and easier to maintain.
