Certainly! Let's dive into each of the SOLID principles with examples and use cases:

**1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**

- **Principle:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.
- **Example:** Consider a `User` class that handles both user authentication and profile management. To adhere to SRP, separate it into a `UserAuthentication` class responsible for authentication and a `UserProfile` class responsible for profile management.
- **Use Case:** In an e-commerce system, the `Order` class should focus on order-specific operations, such as calculating the total cost and managing order items. User authentication and inventory management should be handled by separate classes.

**2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**

- **Principle:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Example:** Instead of modifying an existing `PaymentProcessor` class to add support for a new payment gateway, create a new class that extends the `PaymentProcessor` interface, following the "open for extension" principle.
- **Use Case:** In a content management system, you can add new content types (e.g., articles, videos) without changing the core content management system by creating new content-specific classes that extend an abstract content class.

**3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**

- **Principle:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Example:** Subclasses of a `Shape` class (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`) should be interchangeable without breaking shape-related operations.
- **Use Case:** In a geometric shapes library, you should be able to use a `Square` subclass in the same way as a `Rectangle` superclass without causing unexpected issues.

**4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**

- **Principle:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. It promotes smaller, specific interfaces.
- **Example:** Instead of having a large, all-encompassing `EmployeeOperations` interface that every employee class must implement, create smaller interfaces like `Workable` and `Managable` that specific employee classes can implement.
- **Use Case:** In a human resources system, different employee roles have distinct responsibilities, so you can create specialized interfaces for those responsibilities.

**5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**

- **Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
- **Example:** Instead of a high-level `ReportGenerator` class depending directly on a low-level `DatabaseConnector` class, both depend on an abstract `DatabaseConnection` interface.
- **Use Case:** In an accounting software, a reporting module can use various database systems without modifying the high-level report generation code by depending on an abstract database interface.

These SOLID principles are foundational in creating maintainable and extensible software systems. They help developers produce clean, modular code that can adapt to changing requirements, reduce the risk of introducing new bugs, and encourage reusability. Applying these principles can lead to more efficient and sustainable software development.
