Functional and non-functional requirements are essential aspects of software architecture, helping define what a system should do (functional) and how it should perform (non-functional). Here are scenarios, examples, and use cases that illustrate the distinction between functional and non-functional requirements in software architecture:

**Scenario 1: E-Learning Platform**

**Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Users should be able to search for courses, enroll in courses, complete quizzes, and receive completion certificates.

**Non-Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** The platform should support concurrent access by 1,000 users, with a response time of no more than 2 seconds for search queries.

**Scenario 2: Hospital Management Software**

**Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Healthcare providers should be able to access and update patient records, schedule appointments, and generate billing statements.

**Non-Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Patient data must be encrypted at rest and during transmission to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

**Scenario 3: Social Media Platform**

**Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Users should be able to create posts, like and comment on posts, and follow other users.

**Non-Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** The platform should have a 99.9% uptime, and it should be able to handle a daily peak load of 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

**Scenario 4: Flight Booking System**

**Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Users should be able to search for flights, select seats, make reservations, and receive booking confirmation.

**Non-Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Payment processing must be completed within 5 seconds, and the system should be available 24/7, with a maximum downtime of 15 minutes per month for maintenance.

**Scenario 5: Mobile Health App**

**Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Users should be able to input and track their health data, receive health tips, and schedule telehealth appointments.

**Non-Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** User data should be backed up daily to prevent data loss, and the app should load within 3 seconds on standard mobile devices.

**Scenario 6: Financial Trading Software**

**Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Traders should be able to submit buy and sell orders, view market data, and receive trade confirmations.

**Non-Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** The system must process orders in real-time, with a maximum latency of 100 milliseconds for order execution.

**Scenario 7: Smart Home Automation System**

**Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** Users should be able to control lighting, heating, and security systems using a mobile app.

**Non-Functional Requirement:**

- **Use Case:** The system should be compatible with a wide range of IoT devices, ensuring interoperability and a seamless user experience.

In each scenario, the functional requirements specify the specific features and capabilities the system must have to meet its users' needs. On the other hand, the non-functional requirements focus on performance, security, availability, and other aspects that ensure the system's overall quality and usability. Both types of requirements are critical in defining the architecture and guiding the development of a software system.
