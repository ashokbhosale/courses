Architectural patterns are high-level templates or blueprints that provide proven solutions to recurring design problems in software architecture. They guide the overall structure and organization of a software system, helping architects and developers make informed design decisions. Here's an overview of some common architectural patterns:


1. **Monolithic Architecture:**
    
    - **Description:** A single, self-contained application where all components and functionalities are tightly integrated.
    - **Use Cases:** Used in smaller-scale applications and prototyping.
2. **Pipe and Filter Architecture:**
    
    - **Description:** Decomposes the system into a series of processing stages (filters) connected by pipes through which data flows.
    - **Use Cases:** Often used in data processing and transformation pipelines.

3. **Blackboard Architecture:**
    
    - **Description:** Provides a framework for solving complex, knowledge-intensive problems where multiple independent components collaborate to reach a solution.
    - **Use Cases:** Common in AI and expert systems.
4. **Space-Based Architecture:**
    
    - **Description:** Distributes and processes data across a distributed in-memory data grid, enabling high throughput and scalability.

    - **Use Cases:** Used in high-performance, data-intensive applications.


These architectural patterns provide a structured approach to solving common design challenges. Architects and developers can choose the pattern that best suits their project's requirements, quality attributes, and constraints to create well-structured and maintainable software systems.
